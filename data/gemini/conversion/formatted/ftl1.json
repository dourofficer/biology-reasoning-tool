    "abstract": "Understanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.",
    "introduction": "Investigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases (Ref: 1,2). We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age (Ref: 3-9). Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level (Ref: 1,10). Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain (Ref: 1,11), to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction (Ref: 12-15). Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.",

                "content": "We first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus\u2014a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging (Ref: 11,13)\u2014using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN+ nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons (Ref: 16) (Fig. 1d).\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) (Ref: 17-19) (Fig. 1e\u2013g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) states (Ref: 20). Fe2+ and Fe3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations (Ref: 14), we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity (Ref: 14). Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f\u2013i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired, demonstrating no preference (Fig. 2h,i). As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d\u2013f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.\nTo begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1, we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).\nNext, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d\u2013f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.\nTo determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, neuron-specific conditional Ftl1 genetic knockout mice (FTL1 cKO) using a viral-mediated in vivo CRISPR\u2013Cas9 approach by delivering high-titer lentivirus encoding a synapsin-driven Cre and guide RNA sequences into aged inducible Cas9 transgenic mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95+ excitatory and gephyrin+ inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged FTL1 cKO mice (Fig. 3k). Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1, selectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.\nTo identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j\u2013l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j\u2013l).\nLeveraging our transcriptomic analysis, we next surveyed our in vivo neuronal FTL1 overexpression RNA-seq (Fig. 4a), in vivo neuronal Ftl1 RNA interference RNA-seq (Fig. 4d) and in vivo Ftl1 cKO single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g) datasets for convergent molecular pathways. Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb, Atp5o, Atp5c1, Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).\nConsequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation) (Ref: 21-23) after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2+ neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013d). These transcriptomics and behavioral data indicate that the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function are mediated, at least in part, through alterations in metabolic processes.",

    "discussion": "Cumulatively, our study elucidates a previously unrecognized role for neuronal FTL1 in the progression of aging-associated cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.\nFTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes (Ref: 24)\u2014a key hallmark of the aging process (Ref: 25,26). Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD+ and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents (Ref: 27-29), similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.\nExcess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis (Ref: 30,31), an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Ref: 32,33). Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe2+-specific and Fe3+-specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe2+ or Fe3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio (Ref: 20). The observed decrease in the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.\nAlterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur (Ref: 34,35). Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.\nFrom a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders (Ref: 2,36,37) such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy\u2014a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments (Ref: 38-40). Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Ref: 41). Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people."
