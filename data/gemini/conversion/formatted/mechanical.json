    "abstract": "Phenotype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states (Ref: 1,2). Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.",
    "introduction": "The ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.",

                "content": "To study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion, we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma (Fig. 1a). Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle. Across fish, we found a conserved \u2018interface\u2019 transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment (Ref: 6) (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a).\nTo investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients, we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma (Ref: 7) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets. Similar to our previous observations (Ref: 6), a subpopulation of human tumour cells highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients (Extended Data Fig. 1d\u2013f). To better understand the nature of these cells, we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states. A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated) (Ref: 2). We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state (Ref: 2). Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c).\nMelanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8). MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11). Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log2 fold change (FC) = \u22125.19), TYRP1 (log2FC = \u22127.75) and PMEL (log2FC = \u22128.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log2FC = 5.15), NNAT (log2FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log2FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log2FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i). These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.",

                "content": "To examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state, we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front. Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j,k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12). Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\nTo test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in vitro at predefined heights (3 \u00b5m) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips (Ref: 13) (Fig. 1l). Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.",

                "title": "Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton",
                "content": "Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function (Ref: 14). The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli (Ref: 15). Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16). We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment. We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2\u20134 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16). We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14,17). These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\nAcetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs (Ref: 18). Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19). Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs (Ref: 19). We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAFV600E-driven melanomas and observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border (Ref: 6) (Fig. 2c\u2013e). Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u221212; Fig. 2f\u2013h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved\u2014again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g).\nWe noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus. As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage (Ref: 20,21). During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23). We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism (Ref: 24). Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19). Nocodazole (1 \u00b5M) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j). We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.\nIn addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability (Ref: 25). To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network, we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells. Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26). However, most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27). Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network. These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.",

                "content": "Our results indicate that confinement induces a neuronal identity in interface melanoma cells, characterized by changes in cytoskeletal architecture and gene expression. We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinement-induced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28). Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma (Ref: 29), their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells (Ref: 6). HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells (P = 3.24 \u00d7 10\u221237; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h).\nTo validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e\u2013g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = \u22120.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\u221212; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u22127; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P = 0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase (P = 3.01 \u00d7 10\u22126; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2\u2013GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2\u2013GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c\u2013f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.\nWe examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2+ and AcTub+), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub+ and HMGB2\u2212), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2+ nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub\u2212 and HMGB2+) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates our scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c).\nWe then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types. We focused on two cancer types probably influenced by mechanical stress in vivo: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer. In both, confinement induced significant upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6f\u2013q).\nMechanical stress can be associated with nuclear translocation of transcription factors, such as YAP, as well as epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition inducers, including Twist, Snail and SMAD3 (Ref: 30). To rule out a potential pro-invasive role for these transcription factors upon mechanical stress in melanoma, we quantified their expression in confined A375 cells. None of the factors examined (YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3) exhibited nuclear translocation upon confinement, and the nuclear expression of YAP, Twist and SMAD3 decreased (Extended Data Fig. 7).",

                "content": "To investigate how mechanical confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation, we focused on the MT cytoskeleton, hypothesizing that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network (Fig. 2f,g) may propagate confinement-induced force to the nucleus. To confirm that the perinuclear network is upstream of HMGB2 enrichment in the confinement response, we generated stable A375 cell lines in which HMGB2 was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013c). Upon confining two different A375\u2013HMGB2KO cell lines, we confirmed that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e).\nWe modulated tubulin dynamics and acetylation state in confined cells to determine whether the acetylated tubulin network influences HMGB2 upregulation. Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (Ref: 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (Ref: 32). We first treated A375 cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin (Ref: 33), which increased tubulin acetylation without affecting histone acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013f). In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10\u22126; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 \u00b1 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 \u00d7 10\u22126; Extended Data Fig. 9i). To stabilize MTs independent of acetylation, we treated confined cells with paclitaxel (Taxol), which binds \u03b2-tubulin and prevents tubulin monomer incorporation into MT filaments and thus should not influence the acetylation state of HMGB2 or other proteins (Ref: 34). Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 \u00b1 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects of tubacin on HMGB2, similar results in Taxol-treated and tubacin-treated cells indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions.\nTo confirm the role of perinuclear acetylated tubulin in mediating HMGB2 accumulation, we treated A375[HMGB2\u2013GFP] cells with nocodazole before applying confinement. Nocodazole abolishes most MT networks, with the exception of stabilized acetylated tubulin filaments (Ref: 24). Because the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage was resistant to nocodazole (Fig. 2i,j), nocodazole treatment allowed us to specifically interrogate the contribution of acetylated MTs to HMGB2 upregulation in confined cells. We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j) and HMGB2\u2013GFP accumulation was unaffected (P = 0.714; Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). We quantified HMGB2 accumulation in confined A375\u2013ATAT1KO cells lacking acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 3f), suggesting that acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement.\nThus, we investigated other factors that may cooperate with the MT cytoskeleton to promote upregulation of HMGB2 in confined cells using TurboID (Ref: 35) to perform proximity labelling proteomics targeting HMGB2 interactors (Fig. 3l and Supplementary Table 4). One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2 (gene name: SYNE2), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36) (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesized that nesprin 2 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement. Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\nThe LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36). Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u2212162; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.",

                "content": "Our results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2. HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37). Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize nuclear HMGB2 dynamics upon confinement. As previously reported (Ref: 38), HMGB2\u2013GFP was highly dynamic even in unconfined cells (Fig. 4a\u2013d), with only approximately 25% stably bound within the nucleus (mobile fraction = 75.21 \u00b1 0.91%). In both conditions, FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two-component exponential equation (average coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.986 \u00b1 0.00054; Fig. 4d,e and Methods), indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39). Although more than 90% of HMGB2 remained fast-diffusing in both conditions, confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10\u22125; Fig. 4f), suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2\u2013chromatin interactions in confined cells.",

                "content": "Our FRAP analysis indicates that confinement upregulates HMGB2 and stabilizes its interactions with chromatin; therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g). Peak-gene mapping and pathway analysis revealed that open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes, with increased accessibility at loci linked to the neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h\u2013j and Supplementary Table 5). Homer de novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2OE). The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u221249), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41). Other highly ranked motifs included PRDM4, which functions in neural development (Ref: 42) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u221212), and SOX9, a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma (Ref: 43) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u221211). These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program.\nTo clarify potential HMGB2 targets, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP\u2013seq) targeting HMGB2 in A375 cells using a double-crosslinking approach (Ref: 44) (Extended Data Fig. 11a). We generated a peak atlas by comparing peaks present in cells expressing baseline concentrations of HMGB2 to those not present in HMGB2KO cells, yielding 843 peaks, consistent with previous studies (Ref: 44-46) (Supplementary Table 6). After manual filtering to remove intergenic, low-quality or non-specific peaks, we identified a final high-confidence set of 96 targets (Extended Data Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 6). We observed HMGB2 binding at promoter regions of several AP-1 signalling genes, including FOSL1, JUNB and JUND (Extended Data Fig. 11c and Supplementary Table 6), validating our ATAC-seq results and supporting the pro-invasive role of HMGB2. Several neuronal genes were also identified as HMGB2 targets, including NOTCH2, NOTCH2NLC, TBX6, GBA1 and ZNF335 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6), as well as pro-tumorigenic genes such as KMT2A (Extended Data Fig. 11e and Supplementary Table 6).\nTo examine the transcriptional effects, we performed bulk RNA-seq on A375 cells stably overexpressing HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 11f). HMGB2OE cells adopted a mesenchymal-like and invasive morphology relative to empty vector controls (Extended Data Fig. 11g). The most highly upregulated gene was UNC5D, a netrin receptor promoting neuronal survival and migration (Ref: 47) (Extended Data Fig. 11h and Supplementary Table 7). Other upregulated neuronal genes included DCC, SH3GL2 and NPX2 (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i and Supplementary Table 7). GSEA revealed an overrepresentation of neuronal genes within enriched pathways (Extended Data Fig. 11j,k and Supplementary Table 7). Supporting a pro-invasive role for HMGB2, several invasive genes were also upregulated (MAGEA1, SPP1, CTAG2 and GDF6; Extended Data Fig. 11i and Supplementary Table 7). These data indicate that HMGB2 alters chromatin architecture to promote an invasive neuronal state.",

                "content": "Phenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors (MITF) driving proliferation versus invasive factors (BRN2, SOX9 and AP-1) that also slow proliferation. We investigated whether HMGB2 drives invasion through these factors. Using the SKMEL5 melanocytic cell line, we created a stable line expressing V5-tagged HMGB2 and performed ChIP\u2013seq targeting V5 and HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a). We generated a peak atlas containing 1,361 peaks corresponding to 1,286 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 8). We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the MITF promoter (Extended Data Fig. 12c). However, loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log2FC = 0.157; Extended Data Fig. 12e\u2013g and Supplementary Table 9), indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead. HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells. Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells (DLL1, DLL3 and DLK2; Supplementary Table 1) and confined human melanoma cells (NOTCH2NLA, DLK2 and DLL4; Supplementary Table 2). Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50). This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling. Supporting this model, a BRN2/POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Although MITF and BRN2 expressions are often inversely correlated (Ref: 51), previous reports (Ref: 52,53) and our data indicate that these factors can also be co-expressed. Characterizing the mechanisms that control the expression of these factors and the regulation of the proliferative/invasive trade-off will be an important area for future investigation.",

                "title": "HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching",
                "content": "One prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative (Fig. 5a). Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity. Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b). To visualize the influence of confinement on this trade-off, we generated an A375 cell line stably expressing the FastFUCCI cell cycle sensor (Ref: 54). Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells (mAG+ and S/G2\u2013M phase) rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit (Fig. 5c,d).\nTo directly test the role of HMGB2 in melanoma invasion, we used in vitro invasion assays (Fig. 5e) and found that targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion (P = 0.0133; Fig. 5f,g), whereas overexpression of HMGB2 increased invasion (P = 0.0180; Fig. 5h,i). Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55-57). We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b5m min\u22121; Extended Data Fig. 13a\u2013c), which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system. To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in vivo, we generated BRAFV600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR. Loss of hmgb2 and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks (P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j\u2013l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m). These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state.\nHMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail region (Ref: 58) (Extended Data Fig. 14a). We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma. We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c). We were unable to express a truncated construct lacking both DNA-binding domains, probably because of its small size (24 amino acids). In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either \u0394A-box or \u0394B-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2; this was probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f). Because we were unable to generate constructs lacking both DNA-binding domains, when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j), demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.",

                "content": "Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2). This has important clinical relevance because drug-tolerant persister cells are major contributors to relapse (Ref: 59). We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response, hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance. To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs. Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60), indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation (Ref: 8).\nWe then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in vivo by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib, widely used targeted therapies in melanoma (Ref: 61) (Fig. 5n). HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10). Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15).",

    "discussion": "Single-cell profiling has uncovered reproducible transcriptional states that correspond to distinct tumour phenotypes (Ref: 62). Melanoma cells exist along a phenotypic axis spanning proliferative and invasive states, with a trade-off in which the invasive and proliferative states are mutually exclusive (Ref: 1,2). This is reminiscent of the \u2018go or grow\u2019 hypothesis, in which a cell is optimized for one phenotype over another (Ref: 63). The reproducibility of these states in the absence of genetic lesions indicates they may be epigenetically encoded. We found that the transition from proliferation to invasion is in part mediated by the chromatin-associated protein HMGB2. This family of proteins bends DNA to facilitate the action of transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins, making them ideal candidates for enforcing changes in chromatin configuration in response to external cues. Our data indicate that HMGB2 responds to mechanical forces exerted on the cell, in which upregulation of HMGB2 increases chromatin accessibility at invasive loci. This may explain the persistence of invasive behaviours once a melanoma cell is exposed to microenvironmental forces. Although our study primarily focused on DNA-centric roles for HMGB2, HMGB family proteins also bind RNA to regulate transcriptional and protein\u2013protein interactions, among other functions (Ref: 64). Although we cannot rule out a role for HMGB2\u2013RNA binding in melanoma on the basis of our current data, characterizing this interaction will be an important area for future study.\nThe role of the mechanical microenvironment on tumour cell phenotypes is still emerging. A previous study showed that increased pressure from a stiff collagen matrix could increase cancer invasion (Ref: 65). Cancer-associated fibroblasts can also alter the mechanical microenvironment by secreting matrix metalloproteinases that remodel collagen matrix stiffness (Ref: 66). Our study augments these findings by showing that force can also epigenetically remodel tumour cells through reorganization of cytoskeletal, nuclear and chromatin architectures.\nOur results indicate that confined melanoma cells enact an invasion program reminiscent of developing neurons. During development, neurons assemble a perinuclear tubulin network to protect the nucleus from high levels of force during confined migration (Ref: 22,23), similar to what we observed in invasive melanoma cells. It is unclear whether melanoma cells hijack other neuronal behaviours to promote invasion. A previous study from our laboratory indicated that melanoma cells exploit neuronal-like mechanisms during tumour initiation (Ref: 67), and future studies should aim to explore this phenomenon in later stages of melanoma progression."
