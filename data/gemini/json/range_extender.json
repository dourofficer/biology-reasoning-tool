    "abstract": "Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range (Ref: 1). The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer\u2013promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh (Ref: 2). The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer\u2013promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.",
    "introduction": "Transcriptional enhancers are abundant cis-acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals (Ref: 3\u20137). Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances (Ref: 1,2,8\u201310). Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer (Ref: 8,11\u201314). A central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood (Ref: 1,15). Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer\u2013promoter (E\u2013P) interactions by restricting E\u2013P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs) (Ref: 16\u201320). However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E\u2013P communication and gene expression (Ref: 21\u201325). Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs (Ref: 26\u201331). Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E\u2013P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood (Ref: 1,13,15,32). Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation. Here we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E\u2013P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively abolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E\u2013P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.",

                "content": "To test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice (Ref: 2). Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb (Ref: 33). Owing to the clear phenotypic readout and lack of redundancy, ZRS-Shh is an ideal locus for assessing the long-range enhancer activity of transplanted enhancers. To perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression in the developing limb bud mesenchyme (MM1492 and MM1564 (from mouse) and HS1516 and HS72 (from human); Fig. 1a,b). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA, a posterior domain of the limb mesenchyme where ZRS activates Shh gene expression (Fig. 1b). All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by acetylation at lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27ac) in limb buds, a histone modification that is associated with active enhancers (Fig. 1a). To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC\u2013seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) multiome profiling of 14,000 cells from a wild-type (WT) embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) hindlimb bud (Methods). After clustering all 14,000 cells on the basis of their chromatin and gene expression profiles, we annotated 16 clusters representing all major cell types in the developing limb bud (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers display strong DNA accessibility in Shh positive ZPA cells, consistent with their ability to drive robust reporter expression in posterior limb mesenchyme in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 1a). To link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, we used the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from multiome profiling and E\u2013P physical interaction data based on tissue-resolved high-resolution enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Methods). We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (mouse homologue of HS1516) (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (mouse homologue of HS72) (411 kb away) (Fig. 1c). We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos. This analysis confirmed the above E\u2013P links and additionally identified Rbms1 as a putative target for MM1564 (177 kb away; Fig. 1b,c). We next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology in E18.5 KI mice. Consistent with the loss of limb-specific Shh expression, all four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. The limb phenotypes were indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence of similar length (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.",

                "content": "It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-range enhancers (Ref: 34,35). To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC\u2013seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 KI alleles. HS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC\u2013seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC\u2013seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.",

                "content": "The inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising, given their robust enhancer features and ability to establish open chromatin at the transplanted location. Previously, all four limb enhancers were characterized in transgenic mice using a well-established hsp68 minimal promoter, but their compatibility with the Shh promoter is unclear. To test whether E\u2013P incompatibility (Ref: 36,37) could have a role in the observed differences in gene activation, we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct into fertilized mouse eggs. All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72\u2019s activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter (Ref: 38\u201340). To test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb (Ref: 2,41). As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity (Ref: 42) (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72::Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Importantly, ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.",

Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig. 1c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig. 1c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig. 3a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs. 1b and 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig. 3b). Consistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs. 1b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013c). Notably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.",

We found 33 motifs that match the binding preferences of limb-expressed TFs that are significantly enriched in long-range acting (173 regions; E\u2013P distance, 400 kb to 2 Mb) compared to short-range acting (28 regions; E\u2013P distance, 10\u2013200 kb) enhancer regions (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 and target frequency > 30%), with LHX2 and LHX9 being among the most significantly enriched (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, HD TFs with a similar [C/T]AATTA consensus binding preference, including DLX5, MSX2 and SHOX2, comprised 10 out of these 33 motifs.

                "content": "We next examined whether [C/T]AATTA motifs located inside enhancers are specifically required for their long-range enhancer activity. The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig. 5a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse (Ref: 44). We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRS\u0394HD), drives eGFP. The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig. 5a). We injected the resulting ZRS\u2013mCherry/ZRS\u0394HD\u2013eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). We obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig. 5c). While both the ZRS and ZRS\u0394HD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRS\u0394HD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity (Ref: 45). Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP, indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation (P < 0.0182; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Having established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E\u2013P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRS\u2206HD/\u2206HD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRS\u0394HD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity. These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances. Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T]AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.",

    "discussion": "Here we have identified an evolutionarily conserved signature that is specifically required to confer long-distance E\u2013P communication at the Shh genomic locus. We also describe a prototypical element containing this signature, REX, that is sufficient to confer long-distance interactivity to heterologous short- and medium-range limb enhancers. This finding reveals a fundamental aspect of enhancer function that cannot be measured in traditional transgenic reporter experiments and provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for previous observations that linear distance can impact an enhancer\u2019s ability to activate gene expression (Ref: 46\u201348). Cis-regulatory elements that facilitate enhancer activity continue to emerge as essential regulators of gene expression. This list includes Drosophila tethering (Ref: 49\u201351) and remote control elements (Ref: 52) along with mammalian CTCF sites (Ref: 28,53\u201357), CpG islands (Ref: 58) and facilitator elements (Ref: 59,60). The REX element adds to this list but it does not share sequence similarity with any of the previously described elements. Both the REX element and the ZRS enhancer contain highly conserved [C/T]AATTA-binding sites that are required for long-range activation. Our experiments showing the preferential requirement of [C/T] AATTA motifs for long- but not short-range enhancer activity suggest that their cognate TFs could specifically mediate long-range E\u2013P activation but may not be critical for general transcriptional activation. The [C/T]AATTA motifs match the binding preferences of many HD TFs, notably the LIM-HD TFs LHX2 and LHX9 that are required for normal limb outgrowth (Ref: 61,62). Indeed, LIM-domain-associated TFs such as GATA1, ISL1 and LHX2 are known to facilitate E\u2013P looping at the \u03b2-globin locus as well as the assembly of interchromosomal olfactory gene compartments through their cofactor LIM-domain-binding factor (LDB1) (Ref: 63\u201366). However, their general role in regulating long-range E\u2013P interactions is currently an area of open investigation (Ref: 67,68). Global enrichment of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs in long-distance enhancers suggests that there are probably more REX elements across the genome, with many of them integrated into the enhancer itself, as we showed with the ZRS (Fig. 5f). As our enhancer-substitution experiments were performed at the Shh locus, we cannot rule out the potential impact of locus-specific effects on our findings. Further investigation into long- versus short-range enhancer activity at other genomic loci and across different cell types will be necessary to understand how widespread REX elements are in mammalian genomes and to dissect the molecular mechanism of REX element function. Nevertheless, our results suggest that cell-type specificity and long-range activity are two distinct aspects of gene activation by enhancers, probably fulfilled by separate sets of TFs. This separation will have implications for interpretation of human genetics studies as some non-coding variants will probably affect only long-range enhancer ability while others will disrupt cell-type-specific gene activation."
