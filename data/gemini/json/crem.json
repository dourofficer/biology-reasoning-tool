    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy offers a promising approach against cancer (Ref: 1-3). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA\u2013CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.",
    "introduction": "NK cells have a crucial role in immune surveillance and are able to eliminate abnormal cells independently of major histocompatibility complex class I restriction or antigen priming (Ref: 4). Despite their inherent antitumour activity, NK cells often exhibit functional impairment in the tumour microenvironment secondary to immunosuppressive factors and other tumour escape mechanisms (Ref: 5). The targeting of checkpoints predominantly linked to T cell dysfunction has resulted in substantial advances in immuno-oncology (Ref: 6). However, detailed investigations into the mechanisms that govern NK cell dysfunction are limited. Although the suppressive roles of checkpoints such as TIGIT, TIM3, NKG2A and LAG3 in NK cells are well established (Ref: 7), the effects of others such as PD-1 and CTLA4 on NK cells remain controversial (Ref: 8). Moreover, research has predominantly focused on the targeting of surface receptors, with limited studies of the role of transcription factors that negatively regulate immune responses.\nCAR-NK cells have emerged as a promising immunotherapy for both haematological and solid tumours (Ref: 1). Most clinically advanced CAR-NK cell constructs incorporate interleukin-15 (IL-15) to extend the short lifespan of NK cells (Ref: 3). This approach facilitates strong NK cell activation through CAR-associated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling after antigen binding (Ref: 9), whereas IL-15 promotes proliferation and persistence (Ref: 10). Encouraging clinical outcomes have been reported with NK cells that express both a CD19-directed CAR and IL-15 (CAR19\u2013IL-15) (Ref: 2,3), and CAR-NK cells that target other antigens are in development (Ref: 1). Although some checkpoints of IL-15-mediated NK cell activation have been identified (Ref: 11-13), the mechanisms that regulate NK cell function downstream of combined CAR-associated ITAM and cytokine signalling remain largely unknown.\nHere we identify the PKA\u2013CREB\u2013CREM axis as a key regulatory pathway in CAR-NK cells that are activated by both IL-15 and CAR signalling. Targeting CREM significantly enhances the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells, thereby offering a new strategy to improve cell therapy.",

                "content": "We have previously shown that CAR19\u2013IL-15 NK cells derived from cord blood exert potent activity in vivo (Ref: 14). We also analysed their single-cell transcriptional signatures after adoptive transfer in a non-curative mouse model of lymphoma developed using Raji cells (Ref: 14) (Fig. 1a). To further investigate the regulatory processes that govern the function of CAR19\u2013IL-15 NK cells in vivo, we delved deeper into these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19\u2013IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b). Analyses of differentially expressed genes in CAR19\u2013IL-15 NK cells after infusion revealed notable differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a), with the top upregulated genes including those that encode transcription factors such as CREM, FOS and ASCL2, among others. We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18). Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored.\nElevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterized by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Of note, these cells showed upregulation of genes associated with NK cell inhibition, including ADGRG1, KIR2DL3 and KLRG1 (Fig. 1e). CREM expression in CAR19\u2013IL-15 NK cells remained consistent across all cell cycle stages (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). By contrast, analyses of IL-15 activity using CytoSig showed that it was significantly elevated after infusion (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h) and varied by cell cycle, with the highest levels observed in S phase (Extended Data Fig. 1i). We also observed a significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion, whereby both were increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.",

                "content": "We next asked whether CREM is also induced in CAR-NK cells that target other antigens. To test this possibility, we engineered NK cells to express a CD70-targeting CAR using the CD27 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) (the natural receptor for CD70) fused to CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signalling endodomains without an IL15 transgene (CAR70; Fig. 1f). We also designed and tested CAR variants with altered signalling: one with mutated CD3\u03b6 ITAM phosphorylation sites (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) and another expressing only the CD27 ECD and therefore without intracellular signalling (CD27(ECD)); Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c). Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in non-transduced (NT) NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling (Fig. 1g). This result confirmed the important role of ITAM signalling in CREM induction.\nWe also investigated the effect of IL-15 on CREM induction in NK cells after cytokine starvation. IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent (50\u20135,000 pg ml\u207b\u00b9) increase in CREM expression (Fig. 1h) that was more substantial than with equivalent doses of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and was abrogated by IL-15 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Moreover, stimulation of CAR70 NK cells with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase in CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that both IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) expression and CREM levels increased with elevated IL-15 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2g), with significantly greater CREM expression in IL-15R\u207a than in IL-15R\u207b NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 2h).\nWe next studied the kinetics of CREM induction after IL-15 stimulation and its relationship with Ki67. Although Ki67 increased at 48 h, CREM expression rose earlier and increased by 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). CREM mRNA was upregulated as early as 6 h, peaked at 24\u201348 h and returned to baseline by 96 h (Extended Data Fig. 2k). This finding indicated the occurrence of transient IL-15-induced expression. However, in our CAR\u2013IL-15 system, in which IL-15 is constitutively secreted, CREM remained consistently high after transduction and after expansion with feeder cells and IL-2 treatment, which indicated that it was stably expressed (Extended Data Fig. 2l).\nCREM exists in more than 40 isoforms in humans, generated through distinct promoters, transcription factor activity and alternative splicing (Ref: 21). Some isoforms act as activators (for example, CREM\u03c4, CREM\u03c41, CREM\u03c42 and CREM\u03c4\u03b1), whereas others function as repressors (for example, CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2 and CREM\u03b3) depending on the presence or absence of transactivation domains (Ref: 22). By contrast, the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms arise from an alternative promoter, lack transactivation domains and function exclusively as repressors (Ref: 23) (Extended Data Fig. 3a).\nWe quantified CREM-specific and ICER-specific transcripts in CAR-NK cells and after IL-15 stimulation (Methods). At baseline, NK cells expressed higher levels of CREM-specific transcripts than ICER-specific transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Compared with NT NK cells, CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells showed upregulation of CREM-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, ICER-specific exon 2 transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Similarly, IL-15 induced CREM-specific transcripts in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Using an antibody that recognizes all CREM gene products (Ref: 24,25), we confirmed expression of both CREM and ICER isoforms in NK cells, with CAR\u2013IL-15 NK cells showing increased expression of multiple CREM isoforms above 20 kDa, including CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2, CREM\u03b3 and CREM\u03c4 isoforms (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e).\nCollectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.",

IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response. IL-10 and IL-21 had minimal effects on CREM levels (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To assess the role of ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors, we stimulated NK cells with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp46 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4b), which similarly upregulated CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.",

                "content": "We next explored CREM expression in the context of NK cell exhaustion in the tumour microenvironment. Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets from the TISCH2 database revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells, especially NK cells, T cells and monocytes and macrophages, but minimal expression in malignant or stromal cells. Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI-NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially those from bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This pattern held across multiple cancer types in the TI-NK cell atlas, in which CREM was consistently increased in TI-NK cells compared with PBMC NK cells (Ref: 26) (Extended Data Fig. 5b).\nTo further validate these findings, we analysed TI-NK cells from nine patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, including five primary tumours and four metastatic lesions (Ref: 27). CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI-NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and ranked among the top 50 differentially active regulons in the transcriptome of metastatic TI-NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).\nAnalyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that high CREM expression generally correlated with poor survival in several cancers, including low-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma (Extended Data Fig. 5f).\nFinally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.",

                "content": "Next, we performed mass cytometry to determine the phenotype of CREM-expressing NK cells. NK cells expressing IL-15 without a CAR (IL-15 NK cells), CAR70 (no IL-15) or IL-15-secreting CAR70 (CAR70\u2013IL-15; Fig. 1i) were cultured together with CD70\u207a UMRC3 cells. CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells consistently expressed the highest levels of CREM, followed by CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013c). Six distinct clusters emerged (clusters 1\u20136), with clusters 1 (highest CREM expression), 2 and 4 predominantly found in CAR70\u2013IL-15, CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells, respectively (Fig. 1j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013g).\nCluster 1 was characterized by higher levels of activation markers (NKG2D, CD25, CD2, GZMB and perforin) and inhibitory markers (NKG2A, LAG3, TIGIT and TIM3; Fig. 1l). Similar but more moderate patterns were observed in cluster 2 (most abundant in CAR70 NK cells) and cluster 4 (most abundant in IL-15 NK cells). By contrast, cluster 5 (most abundant in NT cells) had a signature of suppression of both activation and inhibitory markers (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 6h). CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i), a result that supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion.\nCollectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.",

                "title": "CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis",
                "content": "CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30). Thus, to determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation. CAR stimulation resulted in marked CREB phosphorylation in CAR70 NK cells but not in NT or CAR-NK cells with mutated or absent CD3\u03b6 signalling (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F and CD27(ECD), respectively; Fig. 2a,b). These data paralleled previous observations of CREB phosphorylation by PKA downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling (Ref: 31).\nPretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA. Treatment with EGTA led to a consistent suppression of CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Similarly, we observed activation of this pathway in NK cells stimulated through ITAM-associated CD3\u03b6 downstream of CD16, NKp30 and NKp46, which was effectively inhibited by PKA or calcium blockade (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, IL-15 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKA activity (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and pCREB levels in NK cells (Fig. 2e\u2013i), whereas CREB phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in CREM expression were effectively blocked by H89 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) and EGTA (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Together, these data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation.\nThe parallel patterns of CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation or IL-15 stimulation suggested that CREM might be a direct target of CREB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP\u2013qPCR) assays confirmed strong enrichment of CREB on the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a) in CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 2k). Similarly, treatment of NK cells with increasing doses of IL-15 led to a dose-dependent increase in binding of pCREB to the CREM promoter (Fig. 2l). These patterns of CREB and pCREB enrichment correlated with CREM transcription levels in these cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 6a), which strongly indicated that CREM is directly regulated by CREB.\nIL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5. IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in NT NK cells as assessed by western blot analysis, with pSTAT5 showing greater sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). By contrast, CAR activation alone did not induce pSTAT3 or pSTAT5. At baseline, only CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells showed pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 bands, which was probably driven by autocrine IL-15 signalling (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). To determine the role of STAT3 and STAT5 in IL-15-mediated CREM induction, we assessed CREM expression after IL-15 stimulation in wild-type (WT), STAT3 knockout (KO; Extended Data Fig. 7l), STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5A/B) KO (Extended Data Fig. 7m) and CREM KO NK cells. CREM levels were partially reduced in both STAT3 KO and STAT5A/B KO NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 7n), which indicated that both these factors are involved in CREM induction. ChIP analysis did not reveal significant pSTAT3 binding at the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p).\nOur findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5). Notably, CREM induction also occurred independently of STAT signalling, specifically after CAR stimulation in the absence of pSTAT3 and pSTAT5, and instead depended on the PKA\u2013pCREB axis (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.",

                "content": "Our analyses indicated a complex interplay among CAR activation, cytokine signalling and CREM induction. To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells, we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM (an exon shared by most of the non-ICER isoforms) in two CAR-NK cell models: (1) CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d) against CD70\u207a tumour models (the renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC3, the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line BCX.010 of breast cancer and the Raji cell line of Burkitt lymphoma) and (2) TROP2-targeting CAR-NK cells (CAR.TROP2\u2013IL-15; KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e) against TROP2\u207a cancer lines (the pancreatic cancer cell line PATC148 and the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3). CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR\u2013IL-15 NK cells in long-term two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumour spheroid cultures and in tumour rechallenge assays, particularly at low effector-to-target ratios (Fig. 3a\u2013d, Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d and Supplementary Videos 1\u20134).\nFurthermore, CREM KO enhanced the cytotoxicity of IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells in tumour rechallenge assays (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and their ability to produce cytokines (Fig. 3f), with no effect on NT NK cells. Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint.\nTo further elucidate the contributions of CAR signalling and IL-15 on CREM induction, we tested the activity of NK cells expressing different constructs, including IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70\u2013IL-15, as well as those with impaired (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) or absent (CD27(ECD)) CD3\u03b6 endodomain signalling, on UMRC3 spheroids. CREM KO enhanced CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity in conditions in which CAR activation or IL-15 signalling was present, with the greatest effect observed when both pathways were active (CAR70\u2013IL-15; Fig. 3g,h).\nWe tested CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against CD70 KO UMRC3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f). CREM KO enhanced the effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells, regardless of tumour expression of the cognate antigen, but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15 (Extended Data Fig. 8g). This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement. CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells; however, after exposure to increasing concentrations of exogenous IL-15, CREM KO led to enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour targets (Extended Data Fig. 8h).\nTogether, these data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.",

                "content": "We evaluated the impact of CREM KO on CAR-NK cell function in vivo using three different NOD/SCID IL-2R\u03b3null (NSG) mouse models of haematological and solid tumours. To model NK cell exhaustion, we used a mouse model of aggressive CD70\u207a Raji Burkitt lymphoma and treated these mice with long-term cultured (23-day-old) NT, CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells at a subtherapeutic dose (Fig. 4a). Treatment with CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells, NT NK cells or untreated controls (Fig. 4b,c), and resulted in improved survival (Fig. 4d). Moreover, CREM KO led to increased proliferation of CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells in peripheral blood (Fig. 4e) and greater infiltration into the lungs, liver, bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 4f). Notably, the administration of CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells did not cause toxicity, as evidenced by stable body weights in treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also studied the dynamics of ex vivo function and cytokine production of CREM WT and KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells. By day 10 after infusion, CREM WT CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells acquired a dysfunctional phenotype, with reduced cytotoxicity against targets in Raji and K562 cells compared with the original infusion product (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). By contrast, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells maintained their cytotoxic function at this early time point (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). However, by day 20, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells also showed signs of dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). Serum analyses for human cytokines revealed increased levels of TNF, IFN\u03b3, granzyme family members, perforin and other effector molecules in mice treated with CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells, particularly at later time points, which indicated different dynamics of cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Extended Data Fig. 9f).\nIn a metastatic CD70\u207a breast cancer PDX model, NSG mice were engrafted with BCX.010 cells and received intravenous treatment of NT, CREM WT CAR70\u2013IL-15 or CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells 7 days later or were left untreated (Fig. 4g). All mice were euthanized 35 days after NK cell infusion, and tumour burden in the lungs and liver was assessed by histopathology. Mice treated with CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells showed significantly lower tumour burden than all control groups (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9g). CREM KO also led to increased proliferation of CAR-NK cells in peripheral blood and greater infiltration into the lungs and liver (Fig. 4i\u2013l), accompanied by elevated GZMB expression, a result consistent with an activated NK cell phenotype (Fig. 4k,l). In an independent experiment using the same model, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells led to increased survival of mice compared with controls (Fig. 4m). Notably, treatment with CREM KO cells was well tolerated, with no weight loss observed (Extended Data Fig. 9h), and again led to increased CAR-NK cell proliferation in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 9i).\nThese results were further validated in an orthotopic TROP2\u207a PATC148 mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Extended Data Fig. 9j). Mice were euthanized 36 days after NK cell infusion for analyses. Intraperitoneal injection of CREM KO CAR.TROP2\u2013IL-15 NK cells led to improved tumour control (Extended Data Fig. 9k) and in vivo systemic persistence (Extended Data Fig. 9l).\nTargeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity. We further investigated the safety of CREM KO CAR-NK cells using our BCX.010 mouse model. In brief, mice with BCX.010 tumours were treated intravenously with either CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells. As a control, we infused CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells into mice without tumours. Two weeks later, during active NK cell proliferation, mice were euthanized and histological analyses of major organs (liver, lungs and kidneys) did not show notable abnormalities attributable to NK cell therapy in mice treated with either CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In a separate cohort, blood collected from mice with BCX.010 tumours 30 days after infusion of NK cells did not show significant differences in haematological parameters or serum chemistry between mice treated with CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b\u2013d).\nIn summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR-NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile, thereby highlighting the translational relevance of this approach.",

                "content": "To understand how CREM modulates CAR-NK cell function, we performed ChIP\u2013seq using an antibody that recognizes all CREM isoforms to identify genome-wide CREM-binding sites in NK cells. CREM binding was detected across numerous genomic sites, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the enrichment of CREM motifs under ChIP\u2013seq peaks (Fig. 5a). CREM occupancy was higher in IL-15, CAR70\u2013IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells than in NT NK cells (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 11a), a pattern that was also observed for core CREM-binding target genes (Fig. 5c). CREM-bound genes included those relevant to NK cell activity (chemokines and cytokines), cytotoxicity molecules (IFNG, LAMP1 and GZMB), calcium signalling (CAMK1D, CAMK2D and CAMLG) and genes with regulatory function (FOS, FOSB, NFKB2, NFKBIA, STAT3 and EGR1). Some binding targets were unique to specific conditions or shared between similar conditions. For example, DUSP23, DUSP28, EGR4, GZMK, KLRG1, SOCS2 and JUND were common to CAR70 and CAR70\u2013IL-15, whereas CCR1, TMEM family members, EOMES and IL13 were shared between IL-15 and CAR70\u2013IL-15. CISH, SOCS7, NCR1, NCR3, EGR3 and TMEM members were found in all three activated conditions (IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70\u2013IL-15). Hallmark pathway enrichment analysis of CREM target genes identified the MYC targets V1 as the top pathway enriched among all conditions (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 11b). Other pathways, such as TNF signalling through NF-\u03baB, MTORC1 signalling and G2M checkpoint pathways, were also enriched among the targets in CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5d).\nGiven the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP\u2013seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells. CREM KO led to both the upregulation and downregulation of direct CREM target genes, a result that underscores its context-specific regulatory functions (Extended Data Fig. 11c). Although the specific changes in the direct target genes varied among donors (Extended Data Fig. 11d), consistently downregulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses, including BTG1 (Ref: 36), DUSP2 (Ref: 37), SMAD3, NFKB2 (Ref: 3) and RGS1 (Ref: 8). Conversely, CREM KO upregulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2) (Ref: 38,39). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO upregulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it downregulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGF\u03b2 signalling (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and upregulating exhaustion and stress-related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation.\nTo assess the overall impact of CREM on the epigenome, we analysed differences in chromatin accessibility between CREM WT and CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells cultured alone or with UMRC3 cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC\u2013seq). Overall, CREM WT CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells displayed reduced chromatin accessibility when cultured together with tumour cells, whereas CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape under the same conditions (Fig. 5f). Notably, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells cultured together with tumour cells retained accessibility in most cellular metabolic and effector pathways, including MTORC1, PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013MTOR signalling and the mitotic spindle (Extended Data Fig. 11g). Compared with CREM WT, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility at loci associated with activation of E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M targets, MTORC1 signalling and the mitotic spindle, a result consistent with an effector, activated and proliferating NK cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 11h). Indeed, genes associated with effector function (for example, GZMA and PRF1) and transcription factors essential for NK cell maturation and function (for example, EOMES and TBX21) showed increased accessibility in CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 11i).\nMotif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1\u2013JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells, whereas ETS-related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 11j). These patterns of enriched AP-1 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells.\nTo further dissect the mechanisms by which CREM KO improves NK cell function, we first assessed IL-15R proximal signalling. Expression of IL-15R signalling components was comparable between CREM WT and CREM KO NK cells, with some donor-to-donor variability (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Similarly, levels of negative regulators of IL-15R signalling, including SOCS1 and CISH, were not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 12a,c). We next investigated whether CREM KO mirrors the biological effects of IL-15R signalling in NK cells, including enhanced proliferation, extended lifespan and improved metabolic fitness. In keeping with our transcriptomic data of upregulated cell cycle pathways, CREM KO CAR-NK cells showed increased proliferation and extended lifespan, particularly in vivo (Fig. 4e,f,i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9i,l). Moreover, metabolic functional assays revealed enhanced glycolytic capacity and a trend towards increased mitochondrial respiration in CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 12d\u2013i).\nTaken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state (Fig. 5j). This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation, especially members of the AP-1 complex, STAT family and CEBP family (Ref: 41-43).",

    "discussion": "The discovery of T cell immune checkpoints has substantially advanced cancer treatment. However, there remains a need to identify alternative checkpoints that can be exploited across diverse immune cell subsets. Although most immunomodulatory approaches have focused on augmenting T cell responses, recent attention has expanded to harnessing the therapeutic potential of NK cells (Ref: 1). CAR-NK cell therapies, in particular, have demonstrated promising clinical results in B lymphoid malignancies and show promise in preclinical models of solid tumours (Ref: 1,3,43-45).\nIn this study, we identified the role of the PKA\u2013CREB\u2013CREM axis as a key regulator of CAR-NK cell activation. Notably, we showed that CREM can be upregulated by CAR activation and serves as an important checkpoint in CAR-NK cells. These results are in keeping with previous findings that TCR stimulation can induce CREM and ICER (Ref: 46), and that PKA activation and CREB phosphorylation can attenuate TCR signalling (Ref: 31).\nConsistent with findings in other cell types, our results demonstrated that NK cells express various CREM and ICER isoforms at baseline. After CAR activation or IL-15 stimulation, several of these isoforms are strongly upregulated, most prominently CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2, CREM\u03b3 and CREM\u03c4. Although our study did not aim to dissect the individual contributions of each isoform, we focused on establishing the overall function of CREM in CAR-NK cells and evaluating its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance CAR-NK cell efficacy.\nMechanistically, we showed that CAR ligation and downstream CD3\u03b6 signalling activate the PKA pathway, which leads to CREB phosphorylation in NK cells. pCREB then binds to the CREM promoter to initiate its transcription. This sequence of events occurs rapidly and can be disrupted through both PKA inhibition and calcium chelation. IL-15 induces CREM expression in NK cells through a similar mechanism, which is further regulated by STAT3 and STAT5. These findings reveal a complex regulatory axis activated by IL-15 that integrates the canonical JAK\u2013STAT signalling pathway with the cAMP\u2013PKA signalling.\nAlthough CREM has been described as a suppressor of T cell and macrophage function (Ref: 20,47), its role in NK cell biology, especially in the context of CAR therapy, is unclear. Recent studies have reported distinct subsets of NK cells with high CREM expression (Ref: 8,48), although the functional implications were not explored. Here we identified CREM as an immunoregulatory checkpoint in NK cells. CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated CREM KO significantly enhanced the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells, with the greatest effects observed under dual activation by CAR and IL-15. Notably, CREM KO CAR70\u2013IL-15 NK cells exhibited a favourable safety profile in vivo. Nonetheless, further studies will be needed to fully assess long-term safety, particularly in light of potential risks associated with removing intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms.\nOur research extends the understanding of NK cell biology by uncovering the role of the CREM transcription factor in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation. In T cells, CREM can bind the IL2 promoter and regulate its expression (Ref: 46) as well as other target genes, such as those encoding IL-17A (Ref: 49), IL-17F (Ref: 50), SYK (Ref: 51), the CD3\u03b6 chain (Ref: 52) and MIP-1\u03b2 (Ref: 53). In CAR\u2013IL-15 NK cells, our integrated ChIP\u2013seq and RNA-seq analyses revealed that CREM directly binds and represses a broad set of crucial NK cell effector genes. Notably, CREM KO preserved global chromatin accessibility after tumour co-culture, with AP-1 motifs remaining highly accessible, a finding consistent with the previously reported inhibition of JUN\u2013AP-1 activity by CREM (Ref: 54,55). Furthermore, CREM KO increased accessibility at loci encoding key effector genes, including PRF1, GZMA and GZMB.\nIn summary, our study established CREM as a key transcriptional checkpoint in NK cell activation. Targeting CREM may offer a promising strategy to enhance CAR-NK cell activity and persistence. Our findings pave the way for future research into the complex pathways that regulate NK cell function, with potential implications for next-generation immunotherapeutic strategies."
