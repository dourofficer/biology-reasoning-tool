We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype.

The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME).

You must construct the \"Discovery Logic\" triplet by generating the missing `context` and `outcome`.\n\n## Logical Components\n\n1. **Input: Empirical Observation (`main_content`)**\n   This is the specific data point, morphological description, or statistical finding provided to you.\n\n2. **Generate: Established Principle (`context`)**\n   You must generate the \"lens\" through which this data is interpreted. This should be an established biological rule, physical law, or known association (e.g., \"It is well established that protein X is a marker for Y,\" or \"Changes in nuclear shape are indicative of Z\"). This provides the theoretical bridge between the raw number/image and its biological meaning.\n\n3. **Generate: New Insight (`outcome`)**\n   You must generate the novel conclusion or hypothesis that arises from combining the Observation with the Principle. This represents the new understanding or implication for the biological system (e.g., \"Therefore, this suggests the pathway is upregulated,\" or \"This indicates a transition to a mesenchymal state\").\n\n## Reasoning Flow\nYour generation must follow this logical path:\n*We observed [main_content]. Since it is known that [context], we conclude that [outcome].*\n\n## Output Format\nReturn your response in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"main_content\": \"The provided input observation\",\n    \"context\": \"The general biological rule or established theory applied to the data.\",\n    \"outcome\": \"The specific biological interpretation or conclusion derived.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Input (Observation):** \n# Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma\n\n## Abstract\n\nPhenotype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states (Ref: 1,2). Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\nQUERY: These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons ...Acetylated tubulin\nfilaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved\u2014again indicative of stabilization ...We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)", "title": "Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma", "subsection": "Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton", "type": "Q2", "main_content": "These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons ...Acetylated tubulin\nfilaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved\u2014again indicative of stabilization ...We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)", "context": "N/A", "outcome": "These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons."}
