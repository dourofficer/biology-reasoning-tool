Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Q1,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients,"a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7","we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets","Since the interface phenotype identified in the zebrafish model is defined by both a specific spatial location (the tumor boundary) and a distinct transcriptional signature (neuronal/invasive gene program), validating this in human pathology requires a method that preserves tissue architecture while profiling gene expression.",Perform spatial transcriptomics on human melanoma samples to spatially map the expression of the neuronal-like gene program at the interface between the tumour and the surrounding microenvironment.

each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state2.",Characterizing the molecular identity and heterogeneity of tumor subpopulations requires high-resolution gene expression analysis to identify specific transcriptional programs associated with distinct cellular states.,we performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomics.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Q2,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). ... Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g).

The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others8. MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation9,10, whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state11",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.,"It is a well-established principle in melanoma biology that 'phenotype switching' involves the loss of lineage-specific differentiation markers (dedifferentiation) and the reactivation of embryonic neural crest programs, which functions as a mechanism to facilitate plasticity and invasion.","These findings suggest that the specific microenvironmental conditions at the tumor interface induce a lineage regression, driving cells away from the melanocytic identity toward a dedifferentiated, invasive neuronal-like phenotype."
