    "abstract": "Signals from the microenvironment are known to be critical for development, stem cell self-renewal and oncogenic progression. Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified (Ref: 1–5), concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies (Ref: 6) to identify LSC–niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine–taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.",
    "introduction": "Signals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours (Ref: 1–5,7–10). While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours (Ref: 11,12), concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest. Aggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blast-crisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche (Ref: 13–15), their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in vivo leukaemia progression (Ref: 6). This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT–KITL and CD47–thrombospondin 1 (Ref: 16), as well as multiple new signalling axes. Of these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6, was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy (Ref: 17) or support anti-cancer immunity (Ref: 18), a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.",

                "content": "To define temporal changes in non-immune bone marrow microenvironment populations during myeloid leukaemia progression, we used bcCML LSCs, which can grow in unirradiated mouse recipients (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Bone marrow stromal populations (leukaemia⁻CD45⁻TER119⁻) were isolated from leukaemic cohorts at distinct stages of disease progression and analysed using scRNA-seq (Fig. 1a). Gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo-associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d). Our flow-cytometry-based analyses of an independent cohort of leukaemic mice validated these changes, showing increases in MSCs, osteolineage and arteriolar endothelial cells, with a concomitant decline in sinusoidal endothelial populations (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Clustering analyses of genes expressed in major lineages identified gene sets with similar changes in expression (Extended Data Fig. 1f), suggesting that these may represent altered stromal cell fate. Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.",

                "content": "To define the functional relevance of microenvironmental changes on leukaemogenesis, we focused on proteins expressed on LSC cell surface that act as receptors for niche-driven signals. To identify LSC receptors associated with disease progression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of human AML and bcCML CD34⁺ cells, and healthy donor bone marrow CD34⁺ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; Extended Data Fig. 2b). We noted significant (adjusted P (Padj) < 0.05) upregulation of 1,569 genes in bcCML, 2,842 genes in AML and 2,331 genes in both bcCML and AML compared with normal HSPCs. To identify signals that are functionally relevant for disease progression, we found cell surface genes (Ref: 19) that drop out by twofold or more in our genome-wide in vivo leukaemia CRISPR screen (Ref: 6). This identified 13 cell surface signals common to both bcCML and AML, 18 unique to AML and 7 unique to bcCML. Of these 38 genes, 16 were misannotated as cell surface in the reference dataset (Ref: 19) and were removed from further analysis (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). We used NicheNet and the published literature to identify ligands for these receptors, especially those that were significantly upregulated in our TME scRNA-seq data and in the human AML immune microenvironment (Ref: 20) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). This led to the exclusion of receptors with no known ligands (MR1, TMCO3 and TSPAN15) as well as those of which the ligands were not significantly enriched in any TME population (LGALS3BP, CD96, CD274 and CD3D). We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig. 2a). We next determined whether disease progression could alter the expression of LSC-specific TME ligands, and identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr, Cdo1, Apoe and Agt (Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.",

                "content": "Multiple TME–LSC signalling axes identified in our interactome may have a functional role in leukaemia progression. However, we were interested in genes associated with unfavourable outcomes in human patients with AML. Of the 22 genes upregulated in human LSCs, only low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and SLC6A6 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML (Fig. 2a–c and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). We therefore tested the functional requirement of TME-derived ligands of LDLR and SLC6A6 on LSC growth. One of the primary LDLR ligands, apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Ref: 21), was highly expressed in MSCs (Extended Data Fig. 3d). To test the role of APOE from MSCs on LSC function, we co-cultured bcCML LSCs with MSCs transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apoe or LacZ (control; Extended Data Fig. 4c). Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls; Extended Data Fig. 4d–f). SLC6A6 encodes TAUT, which has high affinity for the non-essential amino acid taurine, and low affinity for β-alanine (taurine Km = 4.5 μM versus β-alanine Km = 56 μM) (Ref: 22). Our experiments indicate that Slc6a6 expression can be directly induced by oncogenes (Extended Data Fig. 4g). While the leukaemia TME did not express enzymes required for β-alanine synthesis (Gadl1 and Cndp1), those needed for taurine biosynthesis were expressed in osteo-associated cells (Cdo1 and Csad; Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). Our analysis of publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients (Ref: 23) showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig. 4j). To test whether CDO1 is expressed in the human leukaemia TME, we performed an scRNA-seq analysis of CD45⁻ stromal cells from three myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML bone marrow aspirates. Our analysis of the limited numbers of stromal cells in these samples indicate that CDO1 expression is restricted to the MSC/osteolineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 4k,l), as we see in mouse samples. Notably, we found a marked increase in CDO1 protein expression in nearly all matched biopsies of patients who progressed from MDS to secondary AML, and those who relapsed after AML diagnosis (Fig. 2d–g and Extended Data Fig. 4m–p). While CDO1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated human AML MSCs, its expression increased during in vitro mouse and human AML MSC osteogenic differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). Thus, CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow. Importantly, taurine levels in extracellular medium increased during MSC differentiation, indicating that elevated CDO1 expression is correlated with taurine production (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To determine a functional role of taurine from osteolineage cells, we tested the impact of inhibiting taurine biosynthesis in mouse and human leukaemia bone-marrow-derived MSCs on co-cultured leukaemia cells. Our experiments showed that mouse LSCs co-cultured with osteolineage cells lacking Cdo1 expression were significantly less viable (about 2-fold lower than the controls) and formed fewer colonies (3.4-fold less than controls), which could be rescued by supplementing cultures with taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5e–g). Similarly, inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5h), indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival. Consistent with a functional role of taurine from the TME in leukaemia progression, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig. 2j). In mice, the majority of taurine is synthesized in the liver from cysteine (Ref: 24). To determine whether taurine produced locally in the bone marrow niche is essential for leukaemia growth, we generated a new Cdo1fl/fl mouse model and crossed it to MSC/osteolineage-specific Prrx1-cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 5i–k). We used these as recipients for LSCs and monitored survival, and the impact on bone marrow microenvironment populations. Our experiments showed that Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre⁺ mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls, indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression, at least in part (Fig. 2k). We did not find any significant changes in the composition of TME in Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre⁺ leukaemic mice as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 5l–n), suggesting that leukaemia-driven remodelling of the bone marrow niche does not depend on taurine produced by osteolineage cells. We finally tested whether exogenous taurine supplements can promote leukaemia growth. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of mouse LSCs and patient-derived AML cells increased by 1.2- to 3.3-fold in the presence of taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5o–q). Taurine supplements could significantly accelerate disease progression in immunocompetent mice (around threefold higher likelihood of death relative to the controls; Extended Data Fig. 5r), indicating that taurine can promote leukaemic progression. Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs. As SLC6A6 expression was significantly enriched in both human bcCML and AML LSCs as compared to the controls, we focused our studies on SLC6A6, as it may be broadly required for growth of aggressive leukaemias.",

                "content": "To determine whether TAUT has a functional role in leukaemia progression we used global Slc6a6-knockout mice (Ref: 25) (Fig. 3a,b). While Slc6a6-knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios, they can develop ageing-related defects in bone mass and retinal degeneration (Ref: 25–27). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche. TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig. 6b). TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability (Fig. 3e), as well as a marked increase in the survival of mice transplanted with Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs (40%) relative to control LSCs (0%) in secondary transplant assays (21.2-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3f). The 8.5-fold reduction in colony-forming ability of bcCML LSCs from secondary transplants suggests that these leukaemias remain dependent on TAUT expression and taurine uptake for their continued propagation (Fig. 3g,h). We noted no significant differences in bone marrow microenvironmental populations of mice bearing Slc6a6⁻/⁻ leukaemias as compared to the controls, indicating that leukaemia-driven niche remodelling possibly reflects the extent of the tumour burden, and may be independent of taurine levels within leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c–g). To determine whether TAUT is broadly required for de novo AML growth, we tested the impact of its loss on initiation of leukaemia driven by MLL-AF9/NRAS(G12V) and by AML-ETO9a/NRAS(G12V). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3i–k). Slc6a6⁻/⁻ KIT⁺ AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig. 3l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs. Consistent with a key role of TAUT expression in myeloid leukaemia initiation, TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3m,n). At the cellular level, TAUT loss led to a 2.4- to 3.6-fold reduction in primitive Lin⁻CD150⁻FLT3⁺SCA1⁺ LSCs (Ref: 6) (Fig. 3o). Furthermore, TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin⁺ differentiated cells (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 6h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig. 3q). These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia. We next tested the impact of TAUT loss on normal haematopoiesis. Our analysis indicates that TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady-state (Extended Data Fig. 7a–e). While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Although overall bone marrow chimerism 4 months after transplant was 2.4-fold lower in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ HSC recipients as compared to Slc6a6+/+ HSC recipients, these Slc6a6⁻/⁻ HSCs were able to contribute to all haematopoietic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 7h–k). Serial transplantation of Slc6a6+/+ and Slc6a6⁻/⁻ bone marrow cells showed a similar loss in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ engraftment over time (Extended Data Fig. 7l–q). These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC-enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self-renewal. However, therapeutic inhibition of CD98 showed minimal toxicity in AML phase I trials (Ref: 1) and BCL2 inhibitors are approved for AML therapy. It is therefore possible that non-genetic approaches using small-molecule inhibitors or gene silencing may identify a therapeutic window for TAUT targeting in human cells. We therefore tested the impact of TAUT inhibition on growth and proliferation of normal human HSPCs as well as patient-derived AML cells.",

                "content": "Our analyses of available gene expression datasets indicate that SLC6A6 expression is enriched in leukaemia stem/progenitors as compared to more mature blasts (Extended Data Fig. 8a). While SLC6A6 is broadly expressed in AML irrespective of karyotype or FAB subtype (TCGA; Extended Data Fig. 8b), increased expression correlates with venetoclax resistance (BEAT-AML; Fig. 4a). SLC6A6 expression is also enriched in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-low LSCs from human monocytic AMLs (subtype clinically associated with venetoclax resistance; CD45brightSSChighCD117⁻CD11b⁺CD68⁺) compared with primitive AML (Fig. 4b; CD45medSSClowCD117⁺CD11b⁻CD68⁻) (Ref: 32). We find increased SLC6A6 expression in leukaemia cells carrying RAS mutations as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with data correlating RAS mutations with venetoclax resistance (Ref: 33) (Fig. 4c). SLC6A6 is also highly expressed in relapsed AML originating from stem/progenitor like cells compared with more committed populations (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 8c). These data collectively indicate that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance. To determine whether small-molecule inhibitors of TAUT can effectively block leukaemia growth, we used two well-characterized structural analogues of taurine that inhibit uptake: 6-aminomethyl-3-methyl-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide hydrochloride (Ref: 35) (TAG) and guanidinoethyl sulphonate (Ref: 36) (GES; Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6+/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f–h). Importantly, while TAG and GES impaired growth of primary human AML cells in colony assays by 1.8- to 20-fold, they did not impact normal human CD34⁺ HSPC colony growth (Fig. 4d,e). We next tested whether venetoclax can exacerbate the impact of TAUT loss and/or inhibition on LSC function. Our experiments showed that venetoclax reduced the viability of mouse Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs by 3.2-fold and lowered their colony formation by 13.2-fold as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). While TAG, GES or venetoclax alone could impair mouse LSC colony formation by 1.4- to 3.9-fold, their combination was synergistic and led to 2.3- to 7.2-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8k–m). While primary human AML cells that were treated with GES, TAG or venetoclax alone formed 1.3- to 8.3-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls, combining the treatments substantially impaired colony formation by 2.4- to 150-fold. These data indicate that taurine inhibitors can synergize with venetoclax in blocking the growth of human AML cells (Fig. 4f–h). As TAG and GES did not effectively block taurine uptake in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 9a–j), we used shRNA-based approaches to determine the impact of inhibiting TAUT expression on human AML growth. Knocking down SLC6A6 expression using two independent shRNAs significantly impaired taurine uptake by 2.2 to 3.4-fold, as well as the colony-forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines by 2- to 12-fold (Extended Data Fig. 9k–p). Our experiments showed that SLC6A6 knockdown in samples from patients with AML reduced their colony-forming ability by 2.33- to 9.12-fold as compared to the controls (Fig. 4i). By contrast, SLC6A6 knockdown did not impact colonies formed by normal human CD34⁺ HSPCs (Fig. 4j). Importantly, while SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2- to 40-fold in patient-derived xenograft models (Fig. 4k,l), it did not significantly impair engraftment of normal human CD34⁺ HSPCs in xenograft models (Fig. 4m). Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.",

                "title": "Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia",
                "content": "To establish the mechanisms by which taurine uptake in leukaemia cells promotes disease progression, we determined metabolic changes in the absence of taurine. Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells, suggesting that taurine may regulate energy metabolism (Fig. 5a–c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Consistent with this, we noted a 1.3- to 1.8-fold reduction in basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs as compared to the controls (Fig. 5d,e and Extended Data Fig. 10b). To functionally test the role of glycolysis and TCA associated metabolites, we determined whether bypassing these could rescue Slc6a6⁻/⁻ defects. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs could be significantly rescued by pyruvate, sodium acetate and lactate, but not glucagon (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10c–e). These data suggest that glycolysis, and not gluconeogenesis, is the primary downstream effector of taurine in leukaemia cells. We next tested whether taurine contributed to any cellular metabolite by determining 13C-taurine incorporation in K562 leukaemia cells. Our untargeted metabolomic approach identified 13C label only in known taurine conjugates, N-acetyl taurine and glutaurine (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Membrane-permeable taurine fully rescued colonies formed by Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells (Fig. 5g), and N-acetyl-taurine partly rescued this defect (Extended Data Fig. 10h), perhaps by breakdown to taurine and acetate (Ref: 37). By contrast, glutaurine was unable to rescue the Slc6a6⁻/⁻ colony formation (Extended Data Fig. 10i). These experiments indicate that taurine, and not a secondary metabolite, promotes leukaemia growth due to an indirect effect on glycolysis, possibly through downstream signalling. To identify signals downstream of taurine, we performed RNA-seq as well as phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses of primary mouse leukaemia cells (Fig. 5h). Our RNA-seq analysis identified 932 downregulated and 1,158 upregulated genes in the absence of TAUT (Padj < 0.05). The 1,158 upregulated genes included pathways associated with haematopoietic cell lineage and cell cycle regulation (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). The 932 downregulated genes primarily constituted pathways associated with glycolysis (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 11b–d), consistent with reduced abundance of glycolysis associated metabolites in these cells (Fig. 5c). To determine effectors of glycolytic downregulation on TAUT loss, we performed gene set enrichment analysis. This identified profound downregulation of oncogenic MYC and mTOR pathways (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 11c). As mTOR signalling is known to regulate expression of glycolysis related genes (Ref: 38), we tested whether TAUT loss impairs mTOR activation. Western blot analysis showed that TAUT loss results in a 2.2- to 3-fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k–m and Extended Data Fig. 11e). Our global phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses also showed reduced expression of phosphorylated proteins associated with mTOR signalling, as well as 3.3-fold reduced BCL2 and 1.5-fold increased LC3A expression in the absence of TAUT (Extended Data Fig. 11f,g). Like TAUT loss, TAUT inhibition with TAG and GES downregulated glycolysis-related gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i) and impaired phosphorylation of mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Consistent with a direct impact of taurine on mTOR signalling, acute treatment in vitro and long-term taurine dosing in vivo could activate mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12c–h). Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin impaired the growth of wild-type cells but did not impact Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells in vitro or in vivo (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 12i,k). By contrast, mTOR activation with MHY1485 (Ref: 39) rescued the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs to 60% of the control, and membrane-permeable taurine rescued mTOR activation (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 12j–l). Collectively, these data indicate that mTOR signalling has a key role downstream of taurine in leukaemia cells. Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation. We hypothesized that taurine may activate mTOR by promoting its interaction with RAG GTPases. To test this, we determined the effect of expressing constitutively active RAGA(Q66L) or RHEB(Q64L) on the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 wild-type and null cells. Our experiments showed that, while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6⁻/⁻ colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5p). Furthermore, mTOR phosphorylation in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells could be rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Extended Data Fig. 12m). Finally, we directly tested whether taurine could promote mTOR interactions with lysosomes in wild-type and Slc6a6⁻/⁻ leukaemia cells expressing RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5q). Our immunofluorescence-based analysis showed that, at the baseline, Slc6a6⁻/⁻ cells have 1.2-fold lower mTOR–LAMP1 interaction, which could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L). Taurine supplements increased mTOR–LAMP1 co-localization to levels seen in cells expressing RAGA(Q66L). However, this interaction could not be increased further by adding taurine to RAGA(Q66L)-expressing cells (Fig. 5r,s), consistent with our colony-forming assays (Extended Data Fig. 12n). Collectively, our studies show that the taurine–TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG-mediated activation of mTOR signalling.",

    "discussion": "We use scRNA-seq to define the changing landscape of the non-immune cancer microenvironment with disease progression, and to identify unique niche driven signals that promote disease progression. scRNA-seq has been effectively used to characterize the immune microenvironment of both solid tumours and leukaemias (Ref: 20,42–45). Despite technical limitations in detecting non-immune stromal cells, a few studies have identified antigen-presenting fibroblasts and immune-suppressive endothelial cells in lung and pancreatic cancers (Ref: 46–48). A reduction in osteoblasts has been noted during leukaemia initiation in bone marrow niche damaged by irradiation (Ref: 13). However, dynamic changes in the TME during leukaemia progression have not been defined. Our temporal scRNA-seq based TME analysis identifies an expansion in MSCs and their immature osteo-associated progeny, along with a loss in mature osteo-associated cells. This skew in osteolineage populations possibly results from downregulation of MSC differentiation signals during leukaemia progression, and may explain conflicting findings using candidate osteoblast markers (Ref: 49,50). Our data indicate that temporal expansion in arteriolar endothelial cells is accompanied by a loss in signals that are essential for endothelial cell integrity and function, consistent with leaky blood vessels seen by in vivo imaging of the AML niche (Ref: 1,3,51). In addition to population-level changes, our studies identify signals such as KIT, thrombospondin, taurine and apolipoproteins from the TME that are essential for cancer progression. While multiple TME ligands such as APOE and PVR are detected through the disease trajectory, the populations expressing these can change over time. Thus, therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting TME-driven signals may be more effective than blocking TME remodelling or inhibiting individual stromal populations. Consistent with clinicopathological similarities between AML and bcCML (Ref: 52), our gene expression analysis of human AML and bcCML CD34⁺ LSCs identifies distinct overlap. Our unbiased approach to determine LSC-enriched cell surface receptors that are essential for disease progression identified multiple genes that are known to be critical for AML, including CD96 (Ref: 53), CD47 (Ref: 54) and protein kinase D2 (Ref: 55). Although these are required for leukaemic progression, they are not associated with poor prognosis (TCGA-LAML), in contrast to LDLR and SLC6A6 that we describe here. It is therefore possible that other cell surface receptors identified by our analysis also have a functional role in disease progression and should be explored further to determine new therapeutically relevant signals. As the APOE–LDLR and taurine–TAUT axes that we identify are known to have a role in ageing (Ref: 27,56), it is possible that cancer-associated signals in our TME–LSC interactome may be of broad relevance in ageing-related disorders such as MDSs, as we see with TAUT. Biosynthesis of taurine from cysteine is known to occur in the liver, kidneys, adipose tissues and pancreas (Ref: 24). Our data identify bone marrow osteolineage cells as a novel source of taurine in the leukaemia niche. Our studies blocking taurine produced by osteolineage cells establish a key role of TME-driven taurine synthesis in LSC survival and self-renewal. However, it is possible that taurine or β-alanine produced outside the bone marrow niche also contribute to disease progression. Consistent with this, our data suggest that taurine supplements can accelerate myeloid leukaemia progression in mouse models. As taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks, and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy (Ref: 17), our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in patients with leukaemia. Mechanistically, we identify a critical requirement of taurine from the microenvironment in regulating mTOR-driven glycolysis in leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig. 12o). We can rescue the growth of Slc6a6-null LSCs by circumventing glycolysis with pyruvate or by ectopically activating mTORC1 using GTP-bound RAGA mutants. Our data showing that constitutively active Rag-GTPases can rescue mTOR interactions with lysosomes, and rescue mTOR phosphorylation, in Slc6a6⁻/⁻ LSCs indicate that taurine levels in leukaemia cells may be detected by hitherto unidentified sensors, like those for arginine and leucine (Ref: 57,58). Our in vivo data showing a strong impact of targeting taurine uptake using genetic approaches in AML suggest that it would be of considerable interest to develop stable and effective in vivo inhibitors of taurine in future studies. In light of early clinical success of glutamine inhibitors in MDS and AML (Ref: 59,60), our work suggests that evaluating taurine-transport inhibitors in normal and leukaemic cells may be of therapeutic interest."
