    "abstract": "To grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs (Ref: 1). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines (Ref: 2), in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates—7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol—with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.",
    "introduction": "Metastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site (Ref: 3). The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches (Ref: 1). Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive (Ref: 4). PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes (Ref: 5); however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread (Ref: 6-9). Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis (Ref: 10-16), the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.",

                "content": "High-throughput pooled in vivo screens using barcoded human cancer cell lines (Ref: 2) have revealed organ-specific metastasis patterns across tumour types, including PDAC, which frequently spreads to the liver and lungs. Using data from these screens (https://depmap.org/metmap/), we calculated fractional seeding ratios for 25 PDAC cell lines across 5 metastatic sites (liver, lung, kidney, brain and bone) (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c). Cluster 1 exhibited a mean liver metastatic potential of 70.6% and penetrance of 37.9%, whereas cluster 2 showed low liver tropism (3.5% potential, 9.8% penetrance) and higher lung affinity (31.2% potential, 51.3% penetrance) (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). To validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections. Intrasplenic injection of KP4 or Panc-1 led to liver tumours within four weeks, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II did not grow in the liver (Fig. 1d–g). Conversely, tail vein injection resulted in lung tumours from HPAC and HPAF-II, but not from KP4 or Panc-1 (Fig. 1h–k). Introduction of each cell line into the blood stream via intracardiac injection further confirmed these patterns: KP4 and Panc-1 preferentially colonized the liver, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II favoured the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Notably, all four cell lines share identical KRAS, CDKN2A and TP53 mutations, suggesting that somatic drivers do not explain organ-specific colonization. Together, these results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1-Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2-Lung). To determine whether differential colonization by C1-Liver and C2-Lung cells reflects differences in seeding or outgrowth, we co-injected equal numbers of mCherry-labelled KP4 (KP4-R, C1-Liver) and eGFP-labelled HPAC (HPAC-G, C2-Lung) cells via intrasplenic (liver) or tail vein (lung) routes (Fig. 1l). After 14 days—a time frame sufficient for seeding but not overgrowth—we analysed organs by flow cytometry and 3D light-sheet microscopy. Flow cytometry-based analysis showed enrichment for KP4-R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC-G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Light-sheet microscopy showed large KP4-R foci and very few HPAC-G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig. 1m,n and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.",

                "content": "Prior transcriptional profiling studies have shown that PDAC can be stratified into two main transcriptional subtypes termed ‘basal’ and ‘classical’, which are linked to distinct molecular features and patient prognosis (Ref: 17-21). For instance, basal PDAC displays features of poor differentiation, whereas classical PDAC is well-differentiated. We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2). Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well-differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6—a transcription factor associated with the classical subtype (Ref: 22) (Extended Data Fig. 1h–k). By contrast, liver lesions (35 out of 45) were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining (Extended Data Fig. 1h–m and Supplementary Table 3), consistent with basal-like features (Ref: 20-24). To test whether subtype determines organ avidity, we utilized CRISPR-mediated gene silencing to knock out GATA6 in HPAC cells. Although this shifted transcriptional profiles from classical to basal (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), GATA6 loss did not affect growth or metastatic colonization (Extended Data Fig. 2c–f). Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.",

                "content": "To identify molecular features that distinguish liver-avid versus lung-avid PDAC lines, we performed gene expression correlation analysis (https://depmap.org/) and identified PCSK9 to be the top enriched transcript in GATA6-positive C2-Lung lines (Fig. 2a). High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c). C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). By contrast, C1-Liver lines had little or no PCSK9 and expressed high total and cell surface LDLR levels (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, mouse PDAC cell lines derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC (referred to as KPC (Ref: 25)), showed a similar inverse relationship between PCSK9 and LDLR (Extended Data Fig. 3f), with PCSK9-low lines colonizing the liver and PCSK9-high lines favouring the lung (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). To evaluate expression of PCSK9 and LDLR in primary and metastatic PDAC, we performed immunohistochemical staining of primary specimens from patients with PDAC. Poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases had low expression of PCSK9 and high expression of LDLR, whereas well-differentiated tumours and lung metastases had high PCSK9 expression and low LDLR expression (Fig. 2d–g and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We next utilized a matched cohort of primary PDAC from patients who subsequently developed liver (liver cohort) or lung (lung cohort) only metastases (Ref: 26) (Supplementary Table 6). PDAC tumours from the liver cohort exhibited low PCSK9 and high LDLR staining within the ductal epithelia, whereas tumours from the lung cohort showed high PCSK9 and low LDLR staining (Fig. 2h,i). Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary PDAC and the matched liver metastases (Ref: 27) further confirmed PCSK9 enrichment in classical subtype clusters and its reduction in liver metastases compared with matched primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3i–m). Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.",

                "content": "We next mechanistically evaluated the functional role of PCSK9 in linking regulation of cholesterol homeostasis to target organ selection and colonization. C1-Liver and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed high uptake of fluorescently labelled Dil–LDL as measured by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) and immunofluorescence staining of lysosomal localized Dil–LDL (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f), relative to C2-Lung PCSK9-high cells, which had minimal uptake. Moreover, filipin staining, which visualizes cellular cholesterol depots, revealed high levels of lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver lines consistent with high cholesterol uptake rates, whereas C2-Lung lines predominantly displayed plasma membrane cholesterol and minimal lysosomal staining (Extended Data Fig. 4g–i). Low PCSK9, high LDL uptake and lysosomal cholesterol was also evident in cells isolated from KPC-derived liver metastases, relative to the matched isogenic primary PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 4j–n). LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). In response, C1-Liver lines upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes via SCAP-SREBP feedback (Ref: 28,29) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c); while C2-Lung lines did not (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Similar to lipoprotein depletion, CRISPR-mediated knockout of LDLR also led to a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 5g), was selectively detrimental to C1-Liver lines relative to C2-Lung lines (Extended Data Fig. 5h–j) and impaired growth of KP4 cells in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l).",

Liver metastases also displayed lower expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to the primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Moreover, DepMap data revealed that high PCSK9 expression correlated with dependency on late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis genes in PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Accordingly, knockout of FDFT1 and SQLE impaired growth of C2-Lung lines but not C1-Liver lines, which rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i–k). This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30). Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL uptake.",

                "content": "To test whether PCSK9 levels directly influence organ-specific growth, we first engineered the liver-avid KP4 line to express wild-type PCSK9, a gain-of-function mutant (D374Y) or a loss-of-function variant (R46L) (Ref: 31,32) (Fig. 3e). Wild-type PCSK9 and PCSK9(D374Y) caused a decrease in LDLR levels (Fig. 3e), decreased LDL uptake (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) and a shift towards de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, as evidenced by increased expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes (Fig. 3e). When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver over a period of four to five weeks, whereas cells expressing wild-type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver over the same time frame (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, whereas parental KP4 cells did not grow in the lungs, PCSK9(D374Y)-expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs (Fig. 3f,h). We next tested whether knockout of PCSK9 or overexpression of LDLR in a C2-Lung line, HPAC, was sufficient to enable growth within the liver. CRISPR-mediated knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake and reduced cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d) without affecting in vitro growth (Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, upon tail vein injection, PCSK9-knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells treated with non-targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Fig. 3j–l). Similarly, overexpression of LDLR in HPAC cells phenocopied PCSK9 suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7f–i) and led to increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). Finally, CRISPR-mediated Pcsk9 knockout in mouse PDAC cells transplanted into syngeneic hosts also lead to decreased growth in the lungs and increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7l–s), with no effect on primary pancreatic tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 7t,u). These findings support a model whereby PCSK9–LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively. Our findings show that baseline levels of PCSK9 predict secondary organ preference, especially in patients with liver-only or lung-only metastases (see Fig. 2h). However, PCSK9-high and PCSK9-low cells can coexist within the same primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Since PDAC cells can reach both the liver and lungs regardless of PCSK9 status (see Fig. 1l–n), we tested whether PCSK9 expression still predicts colonization in heterogenous tumours. Using mouse MT23 cells (shown in Extended Data Fig. 4j), which form primary tumours with variable PCSK9 expression, we found that liver metastases uniformly expressed low PCSK9, whereas lung metastases showed high expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). These results confirm that PCSK9 status reliably predicts organ-specific colonization and tumour burden in the liver or the lungs.",

                "content": "We next sought to determine the fate of the LDL-cholesterol actively taken up by C1-Liver cells, and its specific role in promoting survival and colonization of the liver. Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1 (refs. 33,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling. Consistent with this model, DepMap reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data confirmed a positive correlation between liver colonization potential and mTOR activity (Fig. 4c), and patient liver metastases had higher phosphorylated S6 than lung lesions (Fig. 4d). Conversely, high PCSK9 mRNA levels correlated with lower mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig. 9d), supporting a model in which low PCSK9 promotes liver growth via LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake and mTORC1 activation. Following its export from the lysosome, cholesterol can be partly converted to oxysterols by the action of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. In turn, release of oxysterols relieves potential cholesterol overload in the producing cells and can exert modulatory functions on the surrounding tissue, including effects that promote tumour growth and metastasis (Ref: 35). We therefore assessed whether C1-Liver cells express enzymes required for oxysterol production. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) revealed that the mRNA level of CYP46A1, which encodes a cholesterol hydroxylase that synthesizes 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), was upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PDAC dataset (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Other cholesterol hydroxylases showed no correlation with PCSK9 status (Extended Data Fig. 9g), suggesting a specific role for CYP46A1 in C1-Liver cells. In support of this idea, high CYP46A1 expression was correlated with increased liver invasion potential in PDAC cells (Fig. 4f). Studies in the brain have shown that 24-HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37). Given that hepatocytes are the primary source of LDL-cholesterol synthesis in the liver, we tested whether an analogous tumour–hepatocyte circuit may also exist during colonization of the liver. To do so, we measured activation of LXR target genes in primary mouse hepatocytes following incubation for 24 h with conditioned medium isolated from KP4 (C1-Liver) or HPAC (C2-Lung) cells (Fig. 4g). Only conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes (ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRA, PLTP, SREBF1 and APOE) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Similarly, treatment with KP4-conditioned medium but not HPAC-conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig. 9h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4-conditioned medium in hepatocytes. The ability of KP4-conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1 (Extended Data Fig. 9i–k). Accordingly, addition of exogenous 24-HC was able to rescue LXR target gene expression in hepatocytes treated with medium conditioned by CYP46A1-knockout KP4 cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j). To assess whether LXR activation occurs in hepatocytes in vivo, tumour-adjacent and non-adjacent sections from liver metastases were stained for the LXR transcriptional target ABCA1 (Fig. 4i), a cholesterol exporter belonging to the ABC family of transporters. Tumour-adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non-adjacent hepatocytes (Fig. 4j,k), suggesting that hepatocytes in proximity to tumour cells activate LXR target gene expression to a higher degree than non-adjacent hepatocytes. These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth. Consistent with this idea, CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in vitro proliferation, whereas lung growth remained low and unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 9l–o). Thus, CYP46A1-mediated oxysterol signalling promotes liver-specific growth.

                "content": "Finally, we sought to determine how increased de novo synthesis of cholesterol intermediates driven by high PCSK9 levels contributes to lung colonization by PDAC cells. Recent studies have shown that resistance to ferroptosis—an iron-dependent form of cell death involving phospholipid peroxidation (Ref: 38)—is mediated by several late-step cholesterol synthesis intermediates including squalene (Ref: 39) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) (Ref: 40-42). The 5,7-diene B ring structure of 7-DHC functions as a radical-trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref: 40-42), and sterols with similar structural features, such as 7-dehydrodesmosterol (7-DHD), also have anti-ferroptotic capabilities (Fig. 5a). High expression of sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D), 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) and DHCR24 expression, along with several other distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes, positively correlated with PCSK9-high status in samples from patients with PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and in C2-Lung lines (see Extended Data Fig. 6b). Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7-DHC and 7-DHD in HPAC (C2-Lung) versus KP4 (C1-Liver) cells (Fig. 5b,c) and expression of active PCSK9 (D374Y) in KP4 cells was sufficient to increase the levels of these sterols (Fig. 5d,e). To test whether cholesterol biosynthesis influences ferroptosis sensitivity, we treated C1-Liver and C2-Lung PDAC lines with the GPX4 inhibitors RSL3 and ML210. C2-Lung lines were collectively more resistant, showing higher mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values relative to C1-Liver lines (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Similarly, HPAC cells were relatively resistant to RSL3 treatment (Fig. 5g,h). Accordingly, HPAC cells resisted RSL3-induced death, as measured by SYTOX Green, whereas KP4 cells were highly sensitive—an effect that was reversed by adding exogenous 7-DHC or 7-DHD but not desmosterol (Fig. 5g, j). Addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid enhanced RSL3-induced cell death in both KP4 and HPAC cells, but to a greater extent in KP4 cells (Fig. 5g–i). These findings suggest that intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2-Lung cells from oxidative stress. Accordingly, knockout of PCSK9, or blocking the synthesis of 7-DHC and 7-DHD following knockout of SC5D, sensitized HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e) and reduced lung colonization (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). In KP4 cells, expression of dominant active PCSK9(D374Y), which causes a shift towards cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 3e), reduced sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Knockout of SC5D had no effect, consistent with the reduced reliance on sterol biosynthesis in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). Notably, pre-treatment of liver-avid KPC1 cells with 7-DHC or 7-DHD for 24 h in vitro was sufficient to enhance lung colonization following tail vein injection (Fig. 5j,k). Consistent with these findings, unbiased analysis of CRISPR dependency data across 1,005 cancer cell lines showed that PCSK9-low status is strongly associated with sensitivity to GPX4 loss and several additional ferroptosis-protective genes (Fig. 5l) as well as GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10k). Together, these findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death.",

    "discussion": "Most cancer cells exhibit increased synthesis, uptake and storage of lipids for growth and stress adaptation (Ref: 43-46). The optimal balance between these various lipid-handling activities may be partly dictated by energetic constraints: cholesterol synthesis is energetically expensive, thus cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes are subjected to feedback regulation to maintain the levels of this lipid within a defined range that is compatible with growth (Ref: 43,47). Additionally, the mevalonate pathway and distal cholesterol synthesis pathways (the Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell pathways) produce several growth-promoting metabolites, including prenylation precursors, dolichol, ubiquinone (Ref: 45) and anti-ferroptotic derivatives (Ref: 40-42). Owing to the high plasticity and regulation of the mevalonate–cholesterol pathway, the relative contributions of its branches and outputs to various aspects of cancer cell growth have remained unclear. Our study demonstrates that the differential utilization of the mevalonate–cholesterol pathway by PDAC cells can be best understood in the context of colonization of metabolically diverse niches within the liver and lungs (Fig. 5m). PCSK9 emerges as a key determinant of secondary organ colonization preference in PDAC. Although extensive studies of PCSK9, conducted in the context of cardiovascular disease, have uncovered its role as a master regulator of LDLR stability and LDL-cholesterol import, far less is understood about its roles in the altered metabolism of cancer cells (Ref: 48). Here we demonstrate that the ability of PCSK9 to switch PDAC cell metabolism between cholesterol import (PCSK9-low status) versus synthesis (PCSK9-high status), is sufficient to impart different colonization fates. A key finding is that PCSK9 levels determine not only cholesterol uptake versus synthesis, but also distinct usage of mevalonate–cholesterol intermediates and derivatives. Specifically, PCSK9-low liver-avid cells use lysosomal cholesterol to activate mTORC1 signalling and produce 24-HC, to reprogramme the liver microenvironment to support tumour growth. By contrast, PCSK9-high PDAC cells produce 7-DHC and 7-DHD, intermediates with powerful free radical-trapping capabilities, to protect against ferroptosis in the oxygen-rich environment of the lung. This finding explains why liver-avid cells grow less efficiently in the lung, as they show limited production of these intermediates. Accordingly, increasing the amount of PCSK9 in liver-avid cells, which causes a shift towards cholesterol biosynthesis, enables their growth in the lung. Similarly, pre-treatment of liver-avid cells with exogenous 7-DHC or 7-DHD is sufficient to promote growth in the lung. Conversely, exclusive reliance on cholesterol biosynthesis—an oxygen-dependent process—may preclude PCSK9-high lung-avid cells from efficient colonization of the liver, which is characterized by zonal oxygen and metabolite distributions (Ref: 49). Accordingly, ablation of PCSK9 or ectopic LDLR expression in lung-avid cells causes a shift towards cholesterol import and enables growth in the liver. Of note, our findings also highlight an innate ability of all cancer cells to seed within both the liver and lungs—however, the efficiency of outgrowth is dictated by PCSK9 status. Thus, whereas tumour cell-intrinsic PCSK9 status may be predictive of metastatic colonization site, adaptive changes in PCSK9 status over time may also enable growth at these sites. Overall, our findings establish PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site colonization and highlight how differential modes of cholesterol acquisition and utilization can enable growth in metabolically diverse metastatic niches (Fig. 5m). A relationship between cholesterol metabolism and PDAC differentiation has been proposed based on prior transcriptional and functional studies (Ref: 50-52). For instance, high expression levels of cholesterogenic genes in PDAC cells correlates with the classical subtype and overall better prognosis (Ref: 50,52), which we also observe in our study. Conversely, high levels of LDLR were associated with aggressive disease and an increased risk of PDAC recurrence (Ref: 53). A switch from classical to basal differentiation was also shown to occur following deletion of NSDHL—a distal cholesterol biosynthesis gene required for generation of zymosterone—in a mouse model of PDAC (Ref: 51). Although our studies do not establish a direct link between GATA6-dependent differentiation state and PCSK9 expression, they do suggest that PCSK9 is an important node that regulates cholesterol status in parallel to PDAC subtype specific behaviours. Several large-scale studies evaluating the potential benefit of cholesterol-lowering drugs (for example, statins) on cancer incidence and mortality have reported different findings based on population distribution, cancer type, duration of inhibitor use or pre-existing cardiovascular disease (Ref: 44,48,54-56). Moreover, conflicting reports on the benefits of statin use as therapy for advanced cancer have made clinical translation of cholesterol-lowering agents challenging. However, a study evaluating advanced ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancer showed a significant correlation between statin use and decreased risk of mortality (Ref: 57). Another study identified a germline PCSK9-activating mutation that correlated with increased incidence of breast cancer metastasis in women (Ref: 58). However, in this study, host-derived—and not tumour-derived—PCSK9 was linked to increased metastatic competence and, unexpectedly, the downstream mechanism did not involve cholesterol. Together, these studies highlight the importance of understanding the tumour-versus-host functions of PCSK9 and its mechanisms of action across cancer types to most effectively deploy PCSK9 inhibitors. Finally, our study suggests that a more nuanced manipulation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway could enable a greater ability to exploit specific vulnerabilities of cancer cell populations. For instance, interventions that block mTORC1 signalling or tumour cell–hepatocyte cross talk by targeting 24-HC production or LXR activation could antagonize liver colonization. Similarly, the inability of liver-avid PDAC cells to generate 7-DHC and 7-DHD make them more vulnerable to ferroptosis inducing agents, a finding with potential clinical applications. Conversely, the increased dependency of lung-avid PDAC cells on 7-DHC and 7-DHD suggest that directly blocking their production may antagonize lung colonization."
