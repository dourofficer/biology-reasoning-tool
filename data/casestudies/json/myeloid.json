    "abstract": "Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Ref: 1) and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2). Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.",
    "introduction": "A main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T cell and/or natural killer cell responses (Ref: 3). Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the ‘wellspring’ of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 2,4). Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8), but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour–host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies. Here we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.",

                "title": "NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors",
                "content": "To characterize the impact of lung adenocarcinoma growth on myelopoiesis, we profiled progenitors and myeloid lineages in BM of naive and KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl (KP) tumour-bearing mice modelling non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at early (day 7), middle (day 15) and advanced (day 21) time points. We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic–monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a). BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic–monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). In addition, we observed an increased mobilization of Ly6Chi monocytes and Ly6Ghi neutrophils in circulation tracking with tumour burden (Extended Data Figs. 1d and 2b). We also observed an expansion of GMP-derived CD157+Ly6Chi neutrophil-like monocytes in the BM and peripheral blood of late-stage tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1b), previously described to expand in emergency conditions and engender oxidative burst-associated degranulation gene programs (Ref: 9,10). We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in the KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig. 2c).\nGiven that such myeloid expansion is driven by malignancy, we probed how molecular programs are transcriptionally and epigenetically rewired in myeloid progenitors in response to peripheral tumour cues. Experimentally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate myeloid progenitor lineages broadly sorted from the BM of age-matched naive and advanced tumour-bearing mice (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We identified distinct granulocytic (granulocytic progenitor, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil) and monocytic (cMoP, Ly6Chi monocyte, Ly6Clow monocyte) lineages (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 2). We focused on monocytic lineage progenitors (GMP and cMoP) because they are the main source of suppressive mo-macs in tumours (Ref: 11). Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as ‘response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)’, ‘hypoxia response’, ‘regulation of apoptosis’ and ‘metabolic regulation of superoxide generation’, which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\nUsing scRNA-seq profiles of myeloid cells with paired small-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we then correlated gene programs in each myeloid cell state to chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 1i) and focused on transcription factors (TF) driving downstream gene programs. Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions included GATA2, TAL1 and LYL1 (Ref: 14), whereas cMoPs and monocyte marker regions were enriched in IRF4 and SPIB (Ref: 15) (Extended Data Fig. 1j). We then sought to identify TF motifs enriched in differentially accessible regions of tumour-associated cell states. In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as NFE2L2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (Ref: 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA (Ref: 17) (Fig. 1e), when compared with naive counterparts. These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1k). Enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal augmented in tumour-associated GMPs was associated with pathways involved in cellular detoxification, immunoregulation and anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways (Extended Data Fig. 1l). Domains of regulatory chromatin (DORC) scores calculated on H3K4me3 signal–gene association highlighted genes involved in inflammation regulation (for example, S100a8, S100a9, Hif1a, Chil3, Lcn2 and Prtn3), metabolic adaptation under oxidative stress (for example, Hk3, Eif5a, Pkm, Gpi1, Gsr and Aldh2) and mitogen-induced survival (for example, Anxa3, Tnfrsf1a and Serpinb1a) activated in KP-experienced GMPs (Fig. 1g and Methods). On the other hand, we observed a reduction of type I or III interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression in tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors, supporting a dampened inflammatory state (Ref: 18,19) distal to the TME (Fig. 1c). The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs including IRF3, IRF7, IRF5 and STAT2 (Fig. 1e), lower H3K4me3-associated DORC scores at IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) loci such as Ifi203, Oasl1 and Isg15 (Fig. 1g) and lower H3K4me1-associated and H3K27ac-associated DORC scores complemented by higher H3K27me3 repressive histone mark at gene loci such as Ifitm3, Ms4a4c, Mx1 and Gbp4 in tumoural BM myeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 1m) further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity. These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria–ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22). We identified certain binding motifs for TFs such as Nfe2l2 to be enriched in promoter-proximal activating histone marks of tumoural myeloid progenitors, unlike TFs such as Gata2, Mesp1, Glis2 and Tcf3 that are enriched at more distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enhancer-associated signal (Extended Data Fig. 1n).\nSubsequently, we quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC and found that HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC when compared with healthy donors (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2e). We next conducted a 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with NSCLC, to interrogate molecular changes. Mirroring our findings in mice, CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood of patients with early NSCLC had increased oxidative stress response signature scores (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1o) and accessible chromatin topics enriched in these patients were associated with ‘MAPK signalling activation’, ‘metabolic processes’, ‘response to ROS’ and ‘response to oxidative stress’ (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 1p). In support, genes differentially expressed in monocytes from patients with NSCLC were downstream of TF regulators such as NFE2L2, STAT3, PPARG and MYC (Extended Data Fig. 1q). Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.",

                "content": "To measure whether imprinting of stress-responsive programs in BM myeloid progenitors upon sensing systemic tumour cues influence mo-mac states in the TME, we adoptively transferred GMPs from either tumour-bearing mice or naive mice into a tumour-bearing congenic host (Extended Data Fig. 2f). We found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). In addition, we differentiated BM-derived macrophage (BMDM) ex vivo in the presence of tumour conditioning (CM) either early or later during the differentiation. Early exposure to tumour inflammatory cues significantly enhanced mo-mac suppressive phenotype compared with late exposure (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Transient incubation of BM progenitors with KP CM also cued a more immunoregulatory phenotype in progeny macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\nUsing paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis of myeloid cells isolated from naive and tumour-bearing lungs (Extended Data Fig. 2g), we identified discrete inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes, patrolling Ly6Clow monocytes, resident tissue alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and mo-mac subsets such as ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Using gene–gene correlation, we identified a module of genes implicated in anti-apoptotic cytoprotection, glycolytic metabolic shift and regulation of oxidative stress that was highly enriched in tumour-infiltrating ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods), regulated by TFs such as STAT3, NFE2L2, HIF1A, KLF4, SPI1 and CEBPB. We captured a similar diversity of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the scATAC-seq data through independent clustering of chromatin accessibility features (Extended Data Fig. 4c), which aligned with cell-type-specific enrichment of lineage-determining TF motifs (Extended Data Fig. 4d). TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs. Phenotypically, Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 3g). In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\nWe simultaneously used paired single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling to analyse tumour-infiltrating immune cells isolated from 14 human NSCLC lesions (Supplementary Table 3). On the basis of marker gene-based filtering in our 10x Multiome dataset from 5 patients, we isolated 4,177 myeloid cells and classified them according to their nuclear RNA-seq profiles and by weighted gene correlation network analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells included CD14+ monocyte clusters, a transitional mo-mac state that exhibits monocytic features and macrophage markers such as MRC1, CD68 and C1QA; SPP1hi mo-macs (Ref: 25) characterized by SPP1, FBP1 and IL4I1; and TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 26) characterized by GPNMB, CD9, TREM2 and PPARG (Extended Data Fig. 4f and modules in Supplementary Table 4). We integrated the cellular identity from Multiome samples with 24,346 scATAC-seq-captured myeloid cells from 9 patients (Extended Data Fig. 4g). In close agreement with our mouse analyses, we observed motifs for TFs such as NFE2L2, FOSL2, JUN and BACH1 to be enriched in marker peaks of tumour-infiltrating activated CD14+ monocytes, mo-mac_transition and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4h).\nSubsequently, we prioritized TF regulators with sustained cell-type specific activity in TME-infiltrating immunosuppressive mo-macs. Putative TF regulators in our mouse dataset included Spi1, Mafb and Cebpb, as well as NF-κB or Rel family members and AP-1 family members associated with response to inflammation and growth factors (Ref: 27) (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Strikingly, we again observed a nexus of stress-responsive TFs, principally Nfe2l2, Bach1, Fosl2, Mafk and Mafg. Concurrent analyses in our human NSCLC dataset of TME monocytes and mo-macs indicated very similar candidate regulators such as NFKB1, REL, SPIB and CEBPB but also oxidative stress response and integrated stress response regulators NFE2L2, BACH1, MAFF, FOSL2 and ATF4 (Fig. 2b). Downstream pathways conserved across mouse and human TME mo-macs included ‘heme signalling’, ‘cytoprotection by HMOX1’, ‘response to ER stress’ and ‘mitochondrial biogenesis’ (Extended Data Fig. 4j) and ranking on the basis of correlation to gene expression prioritized NFKB1, REL, CEBPB, CEBPG and NFE2L2 (Fig. 2c).",

                "title": "NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME",
                "content": "We were especially interested in NRF2 because of its role in driving antioxidant gene batteries, promoting resistance to lipid-associated ferroptosis and opposing NF-κB pro-inflammatory cascades (Ref: 28,29). NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33). In the lung, we observed relative TF motif deviation for NRF2 and aggregate score for NRF2 downstream gene activation to be highest in immunoregulatory ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs that accumulate in late-stage tumours (Ref: 34) (Fig. 2d). We did not rely on Nfe2l2 gene expression alone, because NRF2 is regulated post-transcriptionally and post-translationally. As a proxy for activation of NRF2 programs in vivo, we assayed the amounts of nuclear NRF2 and intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1, encoded by Hmox1) (Ref: 35). TREM2hi mo-macs had increased amounts of NRF2 and HO-1 compared with CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in KP tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3h), and mo-macs in KP GEMM also had increased amounts of NRF2 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similarly, in human NSCLC, NRF2 TF motif deviation was highest in immunosuppressive TREM2hi mo-macs and recently infiltrated monocytes (mo-mac_transition), with concomitantly high NRF2 downstream gene activation (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, we found the NRF2 activation score to be highest in tumour-associated TREM2hi mo-macs across two independent scRNA-seq datasets (Ref: 36,37) (Extended Data Fig. 3i and Methods).\nGiven the persistent NRF2 pathway activation in TME immunosuppressive mo-macs, we next explored when NRF2 was activated during GMP differentiation to monocytes and mo-macs. We observed increased NRF2 activation and HO-1 induction in mo-macs that differentiate in vivo from adoptively transferred tumour-experienced BM GMPs, and myeloid progenitors exposed to early transient tumour conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). GMPs isolated from KP tumour-bearing mice had increased H3K4me3 promoter-proximal signal at known NRF2 oxidative stress response genes such as Gclm, Alas1, Gsr, Prtn3 and Txnrd1 (Extended Data Fig. 3l), but also key immunosuppressive gene loci such as Cebpb, Ptgs1 (Ref. 38), Inhba (Ref: 39), Lcn2 (Ref. 40) and S100a8 (Ref. 41) (Fig. 2f), suggesting imprinting of immunoregulatory programs early in differentiation. Crucially, although we observed tumour-educated BM GMPs and monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility compared with their tumour-free counterparts, this was not matched by activation of downstream gene programs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Given the downregulation of the IFN-stimulated response in tumour-experienced BM myeloid cells, we next tested the temporal relationship of IFN responsiveness with NRF2 activation. For this, we implanted lung tumours in Mx1GFP IFN-sensitive response element reporter mice (Ref: 42). Here tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Strikingly, there was a stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Several ISGs and antigen-presentation-associated gene loci are potentially regulated by NRF2 and partner TFs at distal enhancer loci, as evident from reduced H3K27ac CUT&RUN marks in KP-experienced GMPs at loci such as Mx1, Ifitm1, Slamf7 and H2-Ab1 (Extended Data Fig. 5e). These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response."

                "title": "Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors",
                "content": "Taking a candidate approach to identify cues that activate NRF2, we found protein factors to be the dominant trigger in tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Specifically, factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin 6 were enriched in BM sera, blood sera and tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). GM-CSF and interleukin 6 mimicked the impact of tumour CM on myelopoiesis, resulting in NRF2 activation, increased HO-1 expression and increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). The myelopoietic effects of KP CM were ameliorated by incubating progenitors with anti-GM-CSF and anti-interleukin 6 neutralizing antibodies, associated with a reduction in oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j). Although there was a reduction in myeloid expansion and HO-1 expression upon incubating progenitors with KP CM in the presence of ML385—an inhibitor of Nfe2l2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Ref: 43) (Extended Data Fig. 6k)—there was an increase in oxidative burden (Extended Data Fig. 6l) suggestive of stress response uncoupling. We found that stress-responsive p38 MAPK signalling was induced in KP CM-experienced progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 6m) but was not affected by ML385 (Extended Data Fig. 6n); this suggested NRF2 pathway activation to be downstream of stress-responsive signal transduction from mitogenic cues such as GM-CSF and interleukin 6. Incubating progenitors with GM-CSF and interleukin 6 in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitor ameliorated myelopoietic expansion as well as HO-1 expression in conjunction with reducing cellular ROS burden (Extended Data Fig. 6o,p). Although we do not exclude other signals in the TME such as heme (Ref: 44), our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand (Extended Data Fig. 6q)."

                "content": "Having established the role of NRF2 in BM myeloid expansion, we interrogated the functional consequence of NRF2 in tumour-associated myeloid cell survival and immunosuppression. Exposing BMDMs to tumour CM during the last 24 h of culture (to mimic polarization in the TME) resulted in immunosuppressive gene activation, cytoprotection and IFN response suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7a). When we cultured BMDMs from NRF2 constitutive knockout mice (Nfe2l2TKO) or wild-type counterparts in the presence of KP CM, we found that tumour-conditioned Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had lower relative activation of Arg1, Retnla and Chil3, while concomitantly expressing higher amounts of the ISGs Mx1 and Nos2 (Fig. 3a). Adding ML385 at day 6 resulted in a similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Remarkably, tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs exhibited increased ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial stress, and increased sensitivity to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). This susceptibility for cell death under redox crisis was specific to tumour condition, because Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs did not exhibit increased cell death at steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Viable tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had reduced expression of HO-1, ARG1 and PD-L1 with increased expression of MHCII, CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 3b), indicating a phenotypic shift towards immunogenicity and antigen presentation.\nNext, we generated conditional knockout mice, wherein NRF2 is floxed by Cre recombinase under the Ms4a3 promoter (Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3) restricted to GMPs (Ref: 45), resulting in decreased NRF2 activity. Myelopoiesis, differentiation and monocyte function in these mice were unaltered at the steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7f–i). We adoptively transferred GMPs from CD45.2 Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 or Nfe2l2fl/fl control BM into congenic CD45.1 hosts bearing KP tumours, and found that GMPs from Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs and strikingly fewer TREM2hi mo-macs in the lung TME, with the TREM2hi mo-macs having decreased PD-L1 (Fig. 3c). GMPs derived from KP-experienced mice treated with quassinoid NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol (Ref: 46), when similarly transferred into congenic tumour-bearing mice, differentiated into more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 3d). Remarkably, GMPs from tumour-naive mice administered antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) differentiated into mo-macs with increased immunosuppressive phenotype (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 7j). Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.",

                "title": "NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis",
                "content": "Considering that peripheral tumours can promote NRF2 priming in BM myeloid progenitors, we interrogated how loss of NRF2 signalling functionally affects myelopoiesis. To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomatoMs4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 3e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 and Nfe2l2fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 8b). We also generated transgenic mice, wherein the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) locus was floxed under Ms4a3Cre (Keap1ΔMs4a3) resulting in GMP-restricted loss of KEAP1, a component of the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex controlling the stability of NRF2, leading to sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1ΔMs4a3 mice when compared with littermates (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We next assessed myelopoiesis in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice. Although NRF2 deletion did not affect steady-state myelopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g), tumour-bearing Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice had significant contraction of BM CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig. 4b). Reduced NRF2 in tumoural mo-macs of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice was associated with a reduction in the number of PD-L1-expressing TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME and a compensatory increase in CD86+MHCII+ immunogenic mo-macs (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice were more susceptible to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 8d), providing rationale for the phenotypic shift in the TME. The mo-mac distribution in Keap1ΔMs4a3 mice was tumour-promoting, with more abundant TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME expressing PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).\nTo measure the cell-intrinsic effect of NRF2 activation on myelopoiesis independent of tumour burden differences, we created mixed-BM chimeras with 1:1 reconstitution of CD45.2 Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 and CD45.1 Nfe2l2WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f). We observed decreased expansion of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 donor-derived GMPs in BM and lower mobilization of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Consequently in the lung, TREM2hi mo-macs of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 origin were also relatively less abundant, whereas CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs were increased (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on the myeloid progenitor lineages in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice and control counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8i) showed the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) to be in GMPs and monocytic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). The GMP, cMoP and mature monocyte clusters in BM of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice had reduced TF motif accessibility for Nfe2l2 and Bach1, Stat3, Myc, Myb, Fosl2 and Atf3 that drive important facets of myeloid differentiation, proliferation and survival (Ref: 47-49) (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8m). Type I or III IFN response regulators such as Irf3, Irf5 and Irf9 were enriched in DARs of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mature Ly6Chi monocytes, matched by reduced accessibility for Hnf1a, Etv3 and Etv6 (Ref: 50) (Extended Data Fig. 8m). Downstream of BM progenitors, molecular programs in lung-infiltrating myeloid cells were significantly altered in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 8n,o). NRF2 activation scores were decreased in Ly6Chi monocytes from Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice, with a concomitant upshift in IFN-responsive gene scores (Extended Data Fig. 8p). Specifically, there was relative enrichment of ISGs (Stat1, Rsad2, Ifit2, Isg20, Ifit3b) and antigen presentation genes (H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Mef2c) in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 TME-infiltrative monocytes and mo-macs, with a decrease in sensing pathways (Ier3, Tlr4, Cd38 and C3ar1), immunoregulatory genes (Chil3, Vcan, S100a8, Ngp, Lcn2, Arg1, Ptgs1 and Prtn3) and NRF2-associated cytoprotective genes (Gpx3, Gclm, Tfec and Ednrb) (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8q).\nTo disentangle how NRF2 affects local reprogramming in the TME from how it influences replenishment through myelopoiesis, we leveraged the tamoxifen-inducible strategy to generate Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3CreERT2 mice and conditionally ablate NRF2 signalling in myeloid precursors before or after tumour exposure. Tamoxifen administration from the time of KP tumour implantation (early) in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig. 4g). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3CreERT2 mice was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4h), reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4i), but insignificant changes to neutrophil mobilization and tumoural infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling, as evidenced by reduced nuclear NRF2 in TME mo-macs, was associated with accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 4j,k). Reduced myeloid NRF2 signalling was associated with significant infiltration of tumoricidal IFNγ+ natural killer cells into lung tumours (Extended Data Fig. 9c–e). Effector CD8+ T cells were also more abundant in the tumours of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). Depletion of monocytes and mo-macs in KP tumour-bearing NRF2-proficient mice resulted in a clear reduction in tumour burden, signifying the importance of mo-macs in KP progression, but such treatment in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice saw no additive impact, suggesting NRF2 activation in mo-macs is crucial to orchestrating immunosuppression (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Furthermore, depletion of natural killer cells in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice resulted in greater tumour burden, highlighting the mode of immunoregulation in this model to be predominantly by means of natural killer cell exclusion and suppression (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 9i).",

                "content": "Given the impact of NRF2 activation on mo-macs curtailing anti-tumour natural killer cell and T cell surveillance, we interrogated whether myeloid NRF2 influences immunotherapy response. In three independent scRNA-seq datasets of immunotherapy or chemotherapy response comparing baseline with post-therapy tissue, tumour-infiltrating mo-macs enriched in non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c and Methods), as well as circulating CD14+ monocytes in non-responders with stable disease (Extended Data Fig. 10d) had DEGs regulated by TFs such as PPARG, TP63, SMAD4 and NFE2L2. Spurred on by our observations, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade. We administered NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol with or without anti-PD-1 therapy starting at day 9 post-KP tumour implant. Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l), affected myelopoiesis as evidenced by the reduction of CMPs, GMPs and cMoPs (Fig. 4m), and reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4n). These systemic changes were associated with a decrease in the abundance of mo-macs, specific decrease in PD-L1+TREM2hi mo-macs and concomitant increase in CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs (Fig. 4o). Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e). A similar dosing regimen using ML385 in conjunction with anti-PD-1 had similarly improved outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 10f). We found the efficacy of combination therapy relied on targeting of myeloid NRF2, because administration of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3Cre mice had no additive impact on anti-tumour immunity (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Anti-tumour immunity was associated with a substantial influx of natural killer cells with increased expression of CD69 and tumoricidal IFNγ (Extended Data Fig. 10h), alongside effector CD8+ T cells lacking exhaustion marks, and producing IFNγ and tumour necrosis factor (Extended Data Fig. 10i)."

    "discussion": "We demonstrate that peripheral tumour cues induce maladaptive myelopoiesis, in part, by altering the oxidative stress response in BM progenitors through NRF2 priming. These findings are indicative of hormetic oxidative stress during steady-state haematopoiesis becoming dysfunctional during chronic inflammation and malignancy (Ref: 51). We further find NRF2-driven programs to be progressively activated in tumour-infiltrating mo-macs, promoting pro-survival, detoxification and immunosuppressive machinery. Our work aligns with evidence of neutrophil reprogramming in the TME (Ref: 52-54), and posits a shared oxidative stress-mediated cytoprotective mechanism across myeloid cells engendering immunosuppression. Our data extend this model, demonstrating that maladaptation of NRF2 signalling is initiated early in tumour-educated BM myeloid progenitors as a ‘first hit’ and reinforced along the mo-mac lineage in the TME. These findings also imply the establishment of epigenetic memory in HSCs and myeloid progenitors (Ref: 55) wrought by tumour inflammation.\nOur data highlight the potential of targeting oxidative stress regulators such as NRF2 in influencing monocyte fate and restoring mo-mac immunogenicity. Targeting NRF2 signalling in myeloid progenitors and TME myeloid cells can have the added benefit of exploiting NRF2-KEAP1 vulnerability in many cancers (Ref: 56). Therapeutics exploiting modalities such as TF-targeted molecular glue degraders and PROTACs (Ref: 57) could provide specific and durable rewiring of monocytic differentiation in the TME. NRF2 is part of a constellation of stress response regulators governing metabolism and proteostasis (Ref: 58-60); future studies will help decipher how these factors interplay with NRF2 in priming cytoprotective and immunoregulatory gene loci in myeloid progenitors to orchestrate TME mo-mac fate."
