{"request_id": 0, "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's start by reading through the task carefully. The user wants me to analyze the provided scientific paper excerpt and identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure in the Results section. The structure consists of Premise (what they found), Connecting Principle (why it matters), and Interpretation (what it means). \n\nFirst, I need to go through each subsection in the Results section. The subsections mentioned are: CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo, CREM is induced by CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, Cytokines and receptor signalling induce CREM, CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells, CREM shapes the NK cell phenotype, CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis, CREM KO enhances CAR-NK cell potency, CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell in vivo activity, and CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape.\n\nFor each subsection, I need to look for the Interpretation first, then the Premise and Connecting Principle. The Interpretation is the conclusion or hypothesis derived from the data. The Premise is the specific finding from the study, and the Connecting Principle is the established knowledge that links the finding to the conclusion.\n\nStarting with the first subsection \"CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo\". The abstract mentions that CREM is induced during peak effector function and coincides with activation and dysfunction. In the Results section, they talk about scRNA-seq data showing CREM upregulation. The interpretation here is that CREM is induced during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a balance of activation and regulatory functions. The premise would be the specific data from the scRNA-seq showing CREM expression and the correlation with effector genes and inhibitory markers. The connecting principle would be the established knowledge that CREM's role in T cells and macrophages is inhibitory, but its role in NK cells is underexplored. \n\nNext, in the subsection \"CREM is induced by CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation\", the authors engineered NK cells with different CAR variants and observed CREM induction only when there was functional ITAM signaling. The interpretation is that both CAR ITAM and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM. The premise is the qPCR results showing CREM upregulation in CAR70 NK cells with functional ITAM. The connecting principle is the known role of ITAM in signaling pathways leading to activation.\n\nIn the \"CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis\" subsection, they show that PKA inhibition and calcium chelation reduce CREM and pCREB. The interpretation is that the PKA\u2013CREB axis is pivotal in CREM upregulation. The premise is the data from the experiments with H89 and EGTA. The connecting principle is the established role of cAMP pathway in regulating CREM via PKA and CREB.\n\nFor \"CREM KO enhances CAR-NK cell potency\", the data shows that CREM KO increases cytotoxicity. The interpretation is that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint. The premise is the enhanced cytotoxicity in KO cells. The connecting principle is the general knowledge that checkpoints regulate immune cell activity.\n\nIn \"CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell in vivo activity\", the in vivo results show better tumour control and survival. The interpretation is that CREM KO enhances efficacy. The premise is the data from the mouse models. The connecting principle is the understanding that inhibitory checkpoints can be targeted to improve therapy.\n\nFinally, in \"CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape\", the ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data show epigenetic changes. The interpretation is that CREM drives dysfunction through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. The premise is the observed gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes. The connecting principle is the established role of epigenetic regulation in cell function.\n\nI need to make sure each component is correctly identified as per the definitions. If any component is missing, mark it as such. For example, in some cases, the connecting principle might be implicit based on general knowledge, so I should note that. Also, check if the interpretations are explicit in the text, as required.\n", "response": "\n\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14).

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA\u2013CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNK cells have a crucial role in immune surveillance and are able to eliminate abnormal cells independently of major histocompatibility complex class I restriction or antigen priming. Despite their inherent antitumour activity, NK cells often exhibit functional impairment in the tumour microenvironment secondary to immunosuppressive factors and other tumour escape mechanisms. The targeting of checkpoints predominantly linked to T cell dysfunction has resulted in substantial advances in immuno-oncology. However, detailed investigations into the mechanisms that govern NK cell dysfunction are limited. Although the suppressive roles of checkpoints such as TIGIT, TIM3, NKG2A and LAG3 in NK cells are well established, the effects of others such as PD-1 and CTLA4 on NK cells remain controversial. Moreover, research has predominantly focused on the targeting of surface receptors, with limited studies of the role of transcription factors that negatively regulate immune responses. CAR-NK cells have emerged as a promising immunotherapy for both haematological and solid tumours (Ref: 1). Most clinically advanced CAR-NK cell constructs incorporate interleukin-15 (IL-15) to extend the short lifespan of NK cells (Ref: 3). This approach facilitates strong NK cell activation through CAR-associated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling after antigen binding, whereas IL-15 promotes proliferation and persistence (Ref: 10). Encouraging clinical outcomes have been reported with NK cells that express both a CD19-directed CAR and IL-15 (CAR19-IL-15) (Ref: 2,3), and CAR-NK cells that target other antigens are in development (Ref: 1). Although some checkpoints of IL-15-mediated NK cell activation have been identified (Ref: 11-13), the mechanisms that regulate NK cell function downstream of combined CAR-associated ITAM and cytokine signalling remain largely unknown. Here we identify the PKA\u2013CREB\u2013CREM axis as a key regulatory pathway in CAR-NK cells that are activated by both IL-15 and CAR signalling. Targeting CREM significantly enhances the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells, thereby offering a new strategy to improve cell therapy.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo\n\nWe have previously shown that CAR19-IL-15 NK cells derived from cord blood exert potent activity in vivo (Ref: 14). We also analysed their single-cell transcriptional signatures after adoptive transfer in a non-curative mouse model of lymphoma developed using Raji cells (Ref: 14) (Fig. 1a). To further investigate the regulatory processes that govern the function of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells in vivo, we delved deeper into these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b). Analyses of differentially expressed genes in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells after infusion revealed notable differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a), with the top upregulated genes including those that encode transcription factors such as CREM, FOS and ASCL2, among others. We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18). Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored. Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterized by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Of note, these cells showed upregulation of genes associated with NK cell inhibition, including ADGRG1, KIR2DL3 and KLRG1 (Fig. 1e). CREM expression in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells remained consistent across all cell cycle stages (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). By contrast, analyses of IL-15 activity using CytoSig showed that it was significantly elevated after infusion (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h) and varied by cell cycle, with the highest levels observed in S phase (Extended Data Fig. 1i). We also observed a significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion, whereby both were increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.\n\n> Fig. 1| CREM is induced by CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation. a, Schematic of the in vivo experiment for the scRNA-seq data (Ref: 14) from the Raji mouse model treated with CAR19-IL-15 NK cells (n = 2 mice each, euthanized on day 7 and day 14). i.v., intravenous.

NS, not significant.\n\n### Subsection: CAR and IL-15 stimulation induce CREM\n\nWe next asked whether CREM is also induced in CAR-NK cells that target other antigens. To test this possibility, we engineered NK cells to express a CD70-targeting CAR using the CD27 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) (the natural receptor for CD70) fused to CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signalling endodomains without an IL-15 transgene (CAR70; Fig. 1f). We also designed and tested CAR variants with altered signalling: one with mutated CD3\u03b6 ITAM phosphorylation sites (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) and another expressing only the CD27 ECD and therefore without intracellular signalling (CD27(ECD)); Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in non-transduced (NT) NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling (Fig. 1g). This result confirmed the important role of ITAM signalling in CREM induction. We also investigated the effect of IL-15 on CREM induction in NK cells after cytokine starvation. IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent (50\u20135,000 pg ml\u207b\u00b9) increase in CREM expression (Fig. 1h) that was more substantial than with equivalent doses of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and was abrogated by IL-15 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Moreover, stimulation of CAR70 NK cells with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase in CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that both IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) expression and CREM levels increased with elevated IL-15 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2g), with significantly greater CREM expression in IL-15R+ than in IL-15R\u207b NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 2h). We next studied the kinetics of CREM induction after IL-15 stimulation and its relationship with Ki67. Although Ki67 increased at 48 h, CREM expression rose earlier and increased by 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). CREM mRNA was upregulated as early as 6 h, peaked at 24\u201348 h and returned to baseline by 96 h (Extended Data Fig. 2k). This finding indicated the occurrence of transient IL-15-induced expression. However, in our CAR-IL-15 system, in which IL-15 is constitutively secreted, CREM remained consistently high after transduction and after expansion with feeder cells and IL-2 treatment, which indicated that it was stably expressed (Extended Data Fig. 2l). CREM exists in more than 40 isoforms in humans, generated through distinct promoters, transcription factor activity and alternative splicing (Ref: 21). Some isoforms act as activators (for example, CREM\u03c4, CREM\u03c41, CREM\u03c42 and CREM\u03c4\u03b1), whereas others function as repressors (for example, CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2 and CREM\u03b3) depending on the presence or absence of transactivation domains (Ref: 22). By contrast, the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms arise from an alternative promoter, lack transactivation domains and function exclusively as repressors (Ref: 23) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We quantified CREM-specific and ICER-specific transcripts in CAR-NK cells and after IL-15 stimulation (Methods). At baseline, NK cells expressed higher levels of CREM-specific transcripts than ICER-specific transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Compared with NT NK cells, CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed upregulation of CREM-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, ICER-specific exon 2 transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Similarly, IL-15 induced CREM-specific transcripts in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Using an antibody that recognizes all CREM gene products (Ref: 24,25), we confirmed expression of both CREM and ICER isoforms in NK cells, with CAR-IL-15 NK cells showing increased expression of multiple CREM isoforms above 20 kDa, including CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2, CREM\u03b3 and CREM\u03c4 isoforms (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.\n\n### Subsection: Cytokines and receptor signalling induce CREM\n\nWe examined the effects of various cytokines on CREM expression. IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response. IL-10 and IL-21 had minimal effects on CREM levels (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To assess the role of ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors, we stimulated NK cells with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp46 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4b), which similarly upregulated CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells\n\nWe next explored CREM expression in the context of NK cell exhaustion in the tumour microenvironment. Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets from the TISCH2 database revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells, especially NK cells, T cells and monocytes and macrophages, but minimal expression in malignant or stromal cells. Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI-NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially those from bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This pattern held across multiple cancer types in the TI-NK cell atlas, in which CREM was consistently increased in TI-NK cells compared with PBMC NK cells (Ref: 26) (Extended Data Fig. 5b). To further validate these findings, we analysed TI-NK cells from nine patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, including five primary tumours and four metastatic lesions (Ref: 27). CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI-NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and ranked among the top 50 differentially active regulons in the transcriptome of metastatic TI-NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that high CREM expression generally correlated with poor survival in several cancers, including low-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Finally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.\n\n### Subsection: CREM shapes the NK cell phenotype\n\nNext, we performed mass cytometry to determine the phenotype of CREM-expressing NK cells. NK cells expressing IL-15 without a CAR (IL-15 NK cells), CAR70 (no IL-15) or IL-15-secreting CAR70 (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 1i) were cultured together with CD70+ UMRC3 cells. CAR70-IL-15 NK cells consistently expressed the highest levels of CREM, followed by CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Six distinct clusters emerged (clusters 1\u20136), with clusters 1 (highest CREM expression), 2 and 4 predominantly found in CAR70-IL-15, CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells, respectively (Fig. 1j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6d-g). Cluster 1 was characterized by higher levels of activation markers (NKG2D, CD25, CD2, GZMB and perforin) and inhibitory markers (NKG2A, LAG3, TIGIT and TIM3; Fig. 1l). Similar but more moderate patterns were observed in cluster 2 (most abundant in CAR70 NK cells) and cluster 4 (most abundant in IL-15 NK cells). By contrast, cluster 5 (most abundant in NT cells) had a signature of suppression of both activation and inhibitory markers (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 6h). CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i), a result that supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion. Collectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis\n\nCREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30). Thus, to determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation. CAR stimulation resulted in marked CREB phosphorylation in CAR70 NK cells but not in NT or CAR-NK cells with mutated or absent CD3\u03b6 signalling (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F and CD27(ECD), respectively; Fig. 2a,b). These data paralleled previous observations of CREB phosphorylation by PKA downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling (Ref: 31). Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA. Treatment with EGTA led to a consistent suppression of CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Similarly, we observed activation of this pathway in NK cells stimulated through ITAM-associated CD3\u03b6 downstream of CD16, NKp30 and NKp46, which was effectively inhibited by PKA or calcium blockade (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, IL-15 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKA activity (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and pCREB levels in NK cells (Fig. 2e\u2013i), whereas CREB phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in CREM expression were effectively blocked by H89 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) and EGTA (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Together, these data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation. The parallel patterns of CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation or IL-15 stimulation suggested that CREM might be a direct target of CREB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP\u2013qPCR) assays confirmed strong enrichment of CREB on the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a) in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 2k). Similarly, treatment of NK cells with increasing doses of IL-15 led to a dose-dependent increase in binding of pCREB to the CREM promoter (Fig. 2l). These patterns of CREB and pCREB enrichment correlated with CREM transcription levels in these cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 6a), which strongly indicated that CREM is directly regulated by CREB. IL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5. IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in NT NK cells as assessed by western blot analysis, with pSTAT5 showing greater sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). By contrast, CAR activation alone did not induce pSTAT3 or pSTAT5. At baseline, only CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 bands, which was probably driven by autocrine IL-15 signalling (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). To determine the role of STAT3 and STAT5 in IL-15-mediated CREM induction, we assessed CREM expression after IL-15 stimulation in wild-type (WT), STAT3 knockout (KO; Extended Data Fig. 7l), STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5A/B) KO (Extended Data Fig. 7m) and CREM KO NK cells. CREM levels were partially reduced in both STAT3 KO and STAT5A/B KO NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 7n), which indicated that both these factors are involved in CREM induction. ChIP analysis did not reveal significant pSTAT3 binding at the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p). Our findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5). Notably, CREM induction also occurred independently of STAT signalling, specifically after CAR stimulation in the absence of pSTAT3 and pSTAT5, and instead depended on the PKA\u2013pCREB axis (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\n\n> Fig. 2| CREM upregulation is mediated through the PKA\u2013pCREB axis. a, Schematic of experiments for b\u2013d.

Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO enhances CAR-NK cell potency\n\nTo determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells, we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM (an exon shared by most of the non-ICER isoforms) in two CAR-NK cell models: (1) CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d) against CD70+ tumour models (the renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC3, the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line BCX.010 of breast cancer and the Raji cell line of Burkitt lymphoma) and (2) TROP2-targeting CAR-NK cells (CAR.TROP2-IL-15; KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e) against TROP2+ cancer lines (the pancreatic cancer cell line PATC148 and the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3). CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumour spheroid cultures and in tumour rechallenge assays, particularly at low effector-to-target ratios (Fig. 3a\u2013d, Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d and Supplementary Videos 1\u20134). Furthermore, CREM KO enhanced the cytotoxicity of IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in tumour rechallenge assays (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and their ability to produce cytokines (Fig. 3f), with no effect on NT NK cells. Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint. To further elucidate the contributions of CAR signalling and IL-15 on CREM induction, we tested the activity of NK cells expressing different constructs, including IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15, as well as those with impaired (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) or absent (CD27(ECD)) CD3\u03b6 endodomain signalling, on UMRC3 spheroids. CREM KO enhanced CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity in conditions in which CAR activation or IL-15 signalling was present, with the greatest effect observed when both pathways were active (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 3g,h). We tested CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against CD70 KO UMRC3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f). CREM KO enhanced the effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells, regardless of tumour expression of the cognate antigen, but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15 (Extended Data Fig. 8g). This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement. CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells; however, after exposure to increasing concentrations of exogenous IL-15, CREM KO led to enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour targets (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Together, these data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\n\n> Fig. 3| CREM KO ameliorates CAR-NK cell function. a, Spheroid killing assay of GFP+ UMRC3 cells by CREM WT NT and CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (n = 3 donors).

Scale bars, 400 \u03bcm (b,h).\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell in vivo activity\n\nWe evaluated the impact of CREM KO on CAR-NK cell function in vivo using three different NOD/SCID IL-2R\u03b3null (NSG) mouse models of haematological and solid tumours. To model NK cell exhaustion, we used a mouse model of aggressive CD70+ Raji Burkitt lymphoma and treated these mice with long-term cultured (23-day-old) NT, CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells at a subtherapeutic dose (Fig. 4a). Treatment with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, NT NK cells or untreated controls (Fig. 4b,c), and resulted in improved survival (Fig. 4d). Moreover, CREM KO led to increased proliferation of CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in peripheral blood (Fig. 4e) and greater infiltration into the lungs, liver, bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 4f). Notably, the administration of CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells did not cause toxicity, as evidenced by stable body weights in treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also studied the dynamics of ex vivo function and cytokine production of CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. By day 10 after infusion, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells acquired a dysfunctional phenotype, with reduced cytotoxicity against targets in Raji and K562 cells compared with the original infusion product (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). By contrast, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells maintained their cytotoxic function at this early time point (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). However, by day 20, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells also showed signs of dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). Serum analyses for human cytokines revealed increased levels of TNF, IFN\u03b3, granzyme family members, perforin and other effector molecules in mice treated with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, particularly at later time points, which indicated different dynamics of cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Extended Data Fig. 9f). In a metastatic CD70+ breast cancer PDX model, NSG mice were engrafted with BCX.010 cells and received intravenous treatment of NT, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 or CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells 7 days later or were left untreated (Fig. 4g). All mice were euthanized 35 days after NK cell infusion, and tumour burden in the lungs and liver was assessed by histopathology. Mice treated with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed significantly lower tumour burden than all control groups (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9g). CREM KO also led to increased proliferation of CAR-NK cells in peripheral blood and greater infiltration into the lungs and liver (Fig. 4i\u2013l), accompanied by elevated GZMB expression, a result consistent with an activated NK cell phenotype (Fig. 4k,l). In an independent experiment using the same model, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells led to increased survival of mice compared with controls (Fig. 4m). Notably, treatment with CREM KO cells was well tolerated, with no weight loss observed (Extended Data Fig. 9h), and again led to increased CAR-NK cell proliferation in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 9i). These results were further validated in an orthotopic TROP2+ PATC148 mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Extended Data Fig. 9j). Mice were euthanized 36 days after NK cell infusion for analyses. Intraperitoneal injection of CREM KO CAR.TROP2-IL-15 NK cells led to improved tumour control (Extended Data Fig. 9k) and in vivo systemic persistence (Extended Data Fig. 9l). Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity. We further investigated the safety of CREM KO CAR-NK cells using our BCX.010 mouse model. In brief, mice with BCX.010 tumours were treated intravenously with either CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. As a control, we infused CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells into mice without tumours. Two weeks later, during active NK cell proliferation, mice were euthanized and histological analyses of major organs (liver, lungs and kidneys) did not show notable abnormalities attributable to NK cell therapy in mice treated with either CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In a separate cohort, blood collected from mice with BCX.010 tumours 30 days after infusion of NK cells did not show significant differences in haematological parameters or serum chemistry between mice treated with CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b\u2013d). In summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR-NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile, thereby highlighting the translational relevance of this approach.\n\n> Fig. 4| CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell efficacy in vivo. a, Schematic of the experimental plan for the Raji mouse model.

Red P values indicate CREM WT versus KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cell group comparisons. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\n### Subsection: CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape\n\nTo understand how CREM modulates CAR-NK cell function, we performed ChIP-seq using an antibody that recognizes all CREM isoforms to identify genome-wide CREM-binding sites in NK cells. CREM binding was detected across numerous genomic sites, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the enrichment of CREM motifs under ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 5a). CREM occupancy was higher in IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells than in NT NK cells (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 11a), a pattern that was also observed for core CREM-binding target genes (Fig. 5c). CREM-bound genes included those relevant to NK cell activity (chemokines and cytokines), cytotoxicity molecules (IFNG, LAMP1 and GZMB), calcium signalling (CAMK1D, CAMK2D and CAMLG) and genes with regulatory function (FOS, FOSB, NFKB2, NFKBIA, STAT3 and EGR1). Some binding targets were unique to specific conditions or shared between similar conditions. For example, DUSP23, DUSP28, EGR4, GZMK, KLRG1, SOCS2 and JUND were common to CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15, whereas CCR1, TMEM family members, EOMES and IL-13 were shared between IL-15 and CAR70-IL-15. CISH, SOCS7, NCR1, NCR3, EGR3 and TMEM members were found in all three activated conditions (IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15). Hallmark pathway enrichment analysis of CREM target genes identified the MYC targets V1 as the top pathway enriched among all conditions (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 11b). Other pathways, such as TNF signalling through NF-\u03baB, MTORC1 signalling and G2M checkpoint pathways, were also enriched among the targets in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5d). Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. CREM KO led to both the upregulation and downregulation of direct CREM target genes, a result that underscores its context-specific regulatory functions (Extended Data Fig. 11c). Although the specific changes in the direct target genes varied among donors (Extended Data Fig. 11d), consistently downregulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses, including BTG1 (Ref: 36), DUSP2 (Ref: 37), SMAD3, NFKB2 (Ref: 3) and RGS1 (Ref: 8). Conversely, CREM KO upregulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2) (Ref: 38,39). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO upregulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it downregulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGF\u03b2 signalling (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and upregulating exhaustion and stress-related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation. To assess the overall impact of CREM on the epigenome, we analysed differences in chromatin accessibility between CREM WT and CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured alone or with UMRC3 cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Overall, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells displayed reduced chromatin accessibility when cultured together with tumour cells, whereas CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape under the same conditions (Fig. 5f). Notably, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured together with tumour cells retained accessibility in most cellular metabolic and effector pathways, including MTORC1, PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013MTOR signalling and the mitotic spindle (Extended Data Fig. 11g). Compared with CREM WT, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility at loci associated with activation of E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M targets, MTORC1 signalling and the mitotic spindle, a result consistent with an effector, activated and proliferating NK cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 11h). Indeed, genes associated with effector function (for example, GZMA and PRF1) and transcription factors essential for NK cell maturation and function (for example, EOMES and TBX21) showed increased accessibility in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 11i). Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1\u2013JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, whereas ETS-related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 11j). These patterns of enriched AP-1 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells. To further dissect the mechanisms by which CREM KO improves NK cell function, we first assessed IL-15R proximal signalling. Expression of IL-15R signalling components was comparable between CREM WT and CREM KO NK cells, with some donor-to-donor variability (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Similarly, levels of negative regulators of IL-15R signalling, including SOCS1 and CISH, were not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 12a,c). We next investigated whether CREM KO mirrors the biological effects of IL-15R signalling in NK cells, including enhanced proliferation, extended lifespan and improved metabolic fitness. In keeping with our transcriptomic data of upregulated cell cycle pathways, CREM KO CAR-NK cells showed increased proliferation and extended lifespan, particularly in vivo (Fig. 4e,f,i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9i,l). Moreover, metabolic functional assays revealed enhanced glycolytic capacity and a trend towards increased mitochondrial respiration in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 12d\u2013i). Taken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state (Fig. 5j). This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation, especially members of the AP-1 complex, STAT family and CEBP family (Ref: 41-43).\n\n> Fig. 5| CREM drives NK cell dysfunction through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. a, CREM-binding motif enrichment in CREM ChIP-seq in NT, IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells (n = 3 donors for NT, IL-15 and CAR70 and one donor for CAR70-IL-15 NK cells; Methods). b, UpSet plot of CREM-binding sites in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells from one representative donor. c, Venn diagram of CREM target genes (within 1 kb vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene) in NT, IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells, with colours referring to the number of targets (blue, lowest to yellow, highest count). d, Hallmark gene sets enriched among the CREM targets in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells and proportion of genes in each set that were recovered among the targets. e, GSEA enrichment plots of upregulated and downregulated Hallmark pathways (only direct targets of CREM from ChIP\u2013seq were considered in each Hallmark pathway) in CREM KO versus WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells by RNA-seq (n = 2 donors); the red dashed lines indicate the top and bottom of the enrichment score. f, Averaged line graphs and heatmaps showing the ATAC-seq signal intensities surrounding the TSS of all genes in CREM KO and WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with or without UMRC3 cells for 24 h (1:1 E/T ratio; n = 2 donors). g, Chromatin accessibility tracks for select genes in CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in culture with UMRC3 cells from one representative donor. h, GSEA of transcription factor motif families differentially accessible in CREM KO versus WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with UMRC3 cells. i, Motif analyses of top open and closed peaks in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with UMRC3 cells.

{"request_id": 1, "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to tackle this task. The user wants me to analyze the provided scientific paper excerpt and identify instances of a three-part logical argument structure in the Results section. The structure is Premise (What We Found), Connecting Principle (Why It Matters), and Interpretation (What It Means). \n\nFirst, I need to understand each component clearly. The Premise is a specific finding from the current study, not referencing previous work. The Connecting Principle is existing knowledge that connects the Premise to a broader context. The Interpretation is the novel conclusion or hypothesis derived from the Premise and Connecting Principle.\n\nI'll start by scanning the Results section subsection by subsection. Let's look at each subsection in order.\n\n**Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME**\n\nThe first part mentions using spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq to find an 'interface' transcriptional cell state in zebrafish. The human data shows a similar subpopulation. They compared to known cell states and found upregulation of undifferentiated and neuronal genes. \n\nLooking for the Interpretation first. In the text, they say: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" That's the Interpretation. \n\nNow, the Premise would be the specific findings: interface cells in zebrafish and human data, gene expression profiles. The Connecting Principle would be the existing knowledge about phenotype switching in melanoma (from the introduction). The text mentions that melanoma behavior is regulated by phenotype switching between proliferative and invasive states, with specific transcription factors. \n\nSo, the triplet would be:\nPremise: Interface cells showed upregulation of undifferentiated state genes and neuronal development genes.\nConnecting Principle: Phenotype switching in melanoma involves transition between proliferative and invasive states regulated by MITF, SOX9, etc.\nInterpretation: Interface cells adopt an invasive state with neuronal markers.\n\n**Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state**\n\nThe authors did in vitro confinement and saw similar gene expression as interface cells, including neuronal pathways. They mention: \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\" That's the Interpretation. \n\nPremise: Confinement of A375 cells in vitro led to upregulation of neuronal pathways, similar to human interface cells.\nConnecting Principle: Previous studies showed that mechanical forces can alter gene expression and cell behavior.\nInterpretation: Confinement induces neuronal identity in interface cells.\n\n**Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton**\n\nThey observed MT remodeling and acetylated tubulin in confined cells, similar to neurons. The Interpretation is: \"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\nPremise: Confined cells showed MT remodeling, acetylated tubulin upregulation, perinuclear network resistant to nocodazole.\nConnecting Principle: Neurons use acetylated tubulin to protect nuclei during migration.\nInterpretation: Confined melanoma cells use similar mechanisms.\n\n**Subsection: Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2**\n\nThey found HMGB2 upregulated in interface and confined cells. The Interpretation is: \"This indicates that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nPremise: HMGB2 is upregulated in interface cells and confined A375 cells, correlating with nuclear shape.\nConnecting Principle: HMG proteins regulate chromatin and respond to mechanical strain.\nInterpretation: Confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\n\n**Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2**\n\nThey found that SYNE2 (nesprin 2) is required for HMGB2 upregulation. The Interpretation is: \"This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\nPremise: SYNE2 upregulation in confined cells, siRNA against SYNE2 blocks HMGB2 and tubulin network.\nConnecting Principle: Nesprin 2 is part of the LINC complex connecting cytoskeleton and nucleus.\nInterpretation: Nesprin 2 and tubulin work together to upregulate HMGB2.\n\n**Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics**\n\nThey used FRAP to show HMGB2 becomes more stable in confined cells. The Interpretation is: \"suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\"\n\nPremise: FRAP shows increased slower-diffusing HMGB2 in confined cells.\nConnecting Principle: HMGB2 typically binds chromatin non-specifically, but can form stable interactions under strain.\nInterpretation: Confinement increases stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions.\n\n**Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci**\n\nATAC-seq showed increased chromatin accessibility at neuronal genes. The Interpretation is: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype.\"\n\nPremise: ATAC-seq in HMGB2-overexpressing cells shows open chromatin at neuronal genes.\nConnecting Principle: Chromatin accessibility affects gene expression and cell state.\nInterpretation: HMGB2 promotes neuronal and plasticity gene expression.\n\n**Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2**\n\nHMGB2 binds Notch genes and upregulates BRN2. The Interpretation is: \"This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.\"\n\nPremise: HMGB2 binds Notch promoters, Notch genes upregulated in interface cells, BRN2 motif in HMGB2 targets.\nConnecting Principle: Notch and BRN2 promote melanoma invasion and neuronal development.\nInterpretation: HMGB2 uses Notch/BRN2 to induce invasion and neuronal traits.\n\n**Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching**\n\nThey found HMGB2 loss leads to hyperproliferative, less invasive tumors. The Interpretation is: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state.\"\n\nPremise: HMGB2 KO cells are less invasive and more proliferative, in vitro and in vivo.\nConnecting Principle: Phenotype switching involves trade-off between proliferation and invasion.\nInterpretation: HMGB2 mediates this trade-off.\n\n**Subsection: HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance**\n\nHMGB2 overexpression reduces drug response. The Interpretation is: \"Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma.\"\n\nPremise: HMGB2 OE tumors are less responsive to drugs, Taxol resistance in confined cells.\nConnecting Principle: Invasive states are linked to drug resistance.\nInterpretation: Confinement via HMGB2 leads to drug tolerance.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these for the components and ensure they fit the structure. Some sections might have multiple triplets, but the example shows one per triplet. Each subsection's triplets are listed. For example, in the first subsection, the triplet is the interface cells' gene expression leading to the conclusion about invasive state with neuronal markers. \n\nI need to make sure the Premise is a specific finding from the current study, not a reference to prior work. The Connecting Principle is existing knowledge, and the Interpretation is the new conclusion. \n\nI'll go through each subsection again to verify. For example, in the HMGB2 and drug tolerance section, the premise is the HMGB2 overexpression and Taxol resistance, the connecting principle is that invasive states are drug-resistant, and the interpretation is that HMGB2 causes drug tolerance.\n\nI think that's all. Now, I'll structure the JSON as per the instructions, making sure to extract the verbatim text and mark any missing components if they are implicit.\n", "response": "\n\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\":

plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states (Ref: 1,2). Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\n\nTo study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion, we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma (Fig. 1a). Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle. Across fish, we found a conserved 'interface' transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a). To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients, we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets. Similar to our previous observations (Ref: 6), a subpopulation of human tumour cells highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients (Extended Data Fig. 1d-f). To better understand the nature of these cells, we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states. A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated) (Ref: 2). We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state (Ref: 2). Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8). MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11). Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log\u2082 fold change (FC) = -5.19), TYRP1 (log\u2082FC = -7.75) and PMEL (log\u2082FC = -8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i). These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\n\n> Fig. 1| Confinement induces an undifferentiated neuronal gene program. a, Schematic detailing the workflow of spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq experiments performed on zebrafish melanomas. b, Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset from Jerby-Arnon et al.\u2077.

Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12). Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in vitro at predefined heights (3 \u00b5m) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips (Ref: 13) (Fig. 1l). Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\n\n### Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n\nNeuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function (Ref: 14). The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli (Ref: 15). Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16). We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment. We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16). We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14,17). These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons. Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs (Ref: 18). Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19). Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs (Ref: 19). We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAFV600E-driven melanomas and observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border (Fig. 2c-e). Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 2f-h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved-again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g). We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus. As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage (Ref: 20,21). During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23). We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism (Ref: 24). Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19). Nocodazole (1 \u00b5M) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j). We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton. In addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability (Ref: 25). To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network, we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells. Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26). However, most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27). Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network. These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage assembles in response to confinement. a, Representative stills from confocal imaging of A375 cells stained with SiR-tubulin.

We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinement-induced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28). Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma (Ref: 2), their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells (Ref: 6). HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells (P = 3.24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2077; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h). To validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P=0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase (P = 3.01 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2-GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2-GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members. We examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2\u207a and AcTub\u207a), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub\u207aand HMGB2\u207b), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2\u207a nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub\u207b and HMGB2\u207a) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates our scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c). We then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types. We focused on two cancer types probably influenced by mechanical stress in vivo: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer. In both, confinement induced significant upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6f-q). Mechanical stress can be associated with nuclear translocation of transcription factors, such as YAP, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers, including Twist, Snail and SMAD3 (Ref: 30). To rule out a potential pro-invasive role for these transcription factors upon mechanical stress in melanoma, we quantified their expression in confined A375 cells. None of the factors examined (YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3) exhibited nuclear translocation upon confinement, and the nuclear expression of YAP, Twist and SMAD3 decreased (Extended Data Fig. 7).\n\n> Fig. 3| HMGB2 is a confinement-induced marker of invasion. a, HMG family expression in interface cells from zebrafish melanoma scRNA-seq. b, Normalized hmgb2a/hmgb2b expression.

To confirm that the perinuclear network is upstream of HMGB2 enrichment in the confinement response, we generated stable A375 cell lines in which HMGB2 was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c). Upon confining two different A375-HMGB2KO cell lines, we confirmed that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). We modulated tubulin dynamics and acetylation state in confined cells to determine whether the acetylated tubulin network influences HMGB2 upregulation. Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (Ref: 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (Ref: 32). We first treated A375 cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin (Ref: 33), which increased tubulin acetylation without affecting histone acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 9a-f). In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 \u00b1 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Extended Data Fig. 9i). To stabilize MTs independent of acetylation, we treated confined cells with paclitaxel (Taxol), which binds \u03b2-tubulin and prevents tubulin monomer incorporation into MT filaments and thus should not influence the acetylation state of HMGB2 or other proteins (Ref: 34). Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 \u00b1 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects of tubacin on HMGB2, similar results in Taxol-treated and tubacin-treated cells indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions. To confirm the role of perinuclear acetylated tubulin in mediating HMGB2 accumulation, we treated A375[HMGB2-GFP] cells with nocodazole before applying confinement. Nocodazole abolishes most MT networks, with the exception of stabilized acetylated tubulin filaments (Ref: 24). Because the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage was resistant to nocodazole (Fig. 2i,j), nocodazole treatment allowed us to specifically interrogate the contribution of acetylated MTs to HMGB2 upregulation in confined cells. We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j) and HMGB2-GFP accumulation was unaffected (P = 0.714; Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). We quantified HMGB2 accumulation in confined A375-ATAT1KO cells lacking acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). Unexpectedly, HMGB2 accumulation was not impaired in ATAT1KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f), suggesting that acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement. Thus, we investigated other factors that may cooperate with the MT cytoskeleton to promote upregulation of HMGB2 in confined cells using TurboID (Ref: 35) to perform proximity labelling proteomics targeting HMGB2 interactors (Fig. 3l and Supplementary Table 4). One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2 (gene name: SYNE2), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36) (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesized that nesprin 2 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement. Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2. The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36). Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\u00b2; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\n\n### Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n\nOur results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2. HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37). Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize nuclear HMGB2 dynamics upon confinement. As previously reported (Ref: 38), HMGB2-GFP was highly dynamic even in unconfined cells (Fig. 4a-d), with only approximately 25% stably bound within the nucleus (mobile fraction = 75.21 \u00b1 0.91%). In both conditions, FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two-component exponential equation (average coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) = 0.986 \u00b1 0.00054; Fig. 4d,e and Methods), indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39). Although more than 90% of HMGB2 remained fast-diffusing in both conditions, confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075; Fig. 4f), suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\n\n> Fig. 4| Confinement-mediated stabilization of HMGB2 increases chromatin accessibility at neuronal loci. a, Representative stills from time-lapse imaging of A375 cells expressing HMGB2-GFP and subjected to FRAP.

Pvalues are indicated (binomial test).\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci\n\nOur FRAP analysis indicates that confinement upregulates HMGB2 and stabilizes its interactions with chromatin; therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g). Peak-gene mapping and pathway analysis revealed that open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes, with increased accessibility at loci linked to the neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h-j and Supplementary Table 5). Homer de novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2OE). The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u2079), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41). Other highly ranked motifs included PRDM4, which functions in neural development (Ref: 42) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2), and SOX9, a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma (Ref: 43) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9). These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program. To clarify potential HMGB2 targets, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) targeting HMGB2 in A375 cells using a double-crosslinking approach (Ref: 44) (Extended Data Fig. 11a). We generated a peak atlas by comparing peaks present in cells expressing baseline concentrations of HMGB2 to those not present in HMGB2KO cells, yielding 843 peaks, consistent with previous studies (Ref: 44-46) (Supplementary Table 6). After manual filtering to remove intergenic, low-quality or non-specific peaks, we identified a final high-confidence set of 96 targets (Extended Data Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 6). We observed HMGB2 binding at promoter regions of several AP-1 signalling genes, including FOSL1, JUNB and JUND (Extended Data Fig. 11c and Supplementary Table 6), validating our ATAC-seq results and supporting the pro-invasive role of HMGB2. Several neuronal genes were also identified as HMGB2 targets, including NOTCH2, NOTCH2NLC, TBX6, GBA1 and ZNF335 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6), as well as pro-tumorigenic genes such as KMT2A (Extended Data Fig. 11e and Supplementary Table 6). To examine the transcriptional effects, we performed bulk RNA-seq on A375 cells stably overexpressing HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 11f). HMGB2OE cells adopted a mesenchymal-like and invasive morphology relative to empty vector controls (Extended Data Fig. 11g). The most highly upregulated gene was UNCSD, a netrin receptor promoting neuronal survival and migration (Ref: 47) (Extended Data Fig. 11h and Supplementary Table 7). Other upregulated neuronal genes included DCC, SH3GL2 and NPX2 (Extended Data Fig. 11h, i and Supplementary Table 7). GSEA revealed an overrepresentation of neuronal genes within enriched pathways (Extended Data Fig. 11j,k and Supplementary Table 7). Supporting a pro-invasive role for HMGB2, several invasive genes were also upregulated (MAGEA1, SPP1, CTAG2 and GDF6; Extended Data Fig. 11i and Supplementary Table 7). These data indicate that HMGB2 alters chromatin architecture to promote an invasive neuronal state.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors (MITF) driving proliferation versus invasive factors (BRN2, SOX9 and AP-1) that also slow proliferation. We investigated whether HMGB2 drives invasion through these factors. Using the SKMEL5 melanocytic cell line, we created a stable line expressing V5-tagged HMGB2 and performed ChIP-seq targeting V5 and HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a). We generated a peak atlas containing 1,361 peaks corresponding to 1,286 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 8). We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the MITF promoter (Extended Data Fig. 12c). However, loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log\u2082FC = 0.157; Extended Data Fig. 12e-g and Supplementary Table 9), indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead. HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells. Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells (DLL1, DLL3 and DLK2; Supplementary Table 1) and confined human melanoma cells (NOTCH2NLA, DLK2 and DLL4; Supplementary Table 2). Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50). This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling. Supporting this model, a BRN2/POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Although MITF and BRN2 expressions are often inversely correlated (Ref: 1), previous reports (Ref: 52,53) and our data indicate that these factors can also be co-expressed. Characterizing the mechanisms that control the expression of these factors and the regulation of the proliferative/invasive trade-off will be an important area for future investigation.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching\n\nOne prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative (Fig. 5a). Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity. Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b). To visualize the influence of confinement on this trade-off, we generated an A375 cell line stably expressing the FastFUCCI cell cycle sensor (Ref: 54). Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells (mAG\u207a and S/G2-M phase) rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit (Fig. 5c,d). To directly test the role of HMGB2 in melanoma invasion, we used in vitro invasion assays (Fig. 5e) and found that targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion (P = 0.0133; Fig. 5f,g), whereas overexpression of HMGB2 increased invasion (P = 0.0180; Fig. 5h,i). Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55-57). We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b5m min\u207b\u00b9; Extended Data Fig. 13a-c), which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system. To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in vivo, we generated BRAFV600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR. Loss of hmgb2a and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks (P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j-l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m). These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state. HMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail regions (Extended Data Fig. 14a). We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma. We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c). We were unable to express a truncated construct lacking both DNA-binding domains, probably because of its small size (24 amino acids). In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2; this was probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f). Because we were unable to generate constructs lacking both DNA-binding domains, when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j), demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\n\n> Fig. 5| Confinement promotes drug tolerance by downregulating proliferation. a, Schematic detailing the influence of confinement on melanoma phenotype switching. b, Enrichment scores for GO:BP pathways related to cell division from RNA-seq of confined cells relative to unconfined cells.

This has important clinical relevance because drug-tolerant persister cells are major contributors to relapse (Ref: 59). We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response, hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance. To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs. Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60), indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation. We then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in vivo by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib, widely used targeted therapies in melanoma (Ref: 61) (Fig. 5n). HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10). Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15).\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Premise (The \"What We Found\"):**\n*   **Definition:** An empirical result, observation, or data point generated *specifically within the current study*.\n*   **Identifiers:** Look for direct statements of results (\"We found that...\", \"Our analysis revealed...\"), often linked to figures or tables (\"(Fig. 1a)\").\n*   **Constraint:** This component **must not** be a statement of established knowledge supported by a citation to *another paper*.\n*   **Implicitness:** If the finding is established in a previous paragraph and acts as an unspoken foundation, or is simply understood from context without being restated, mark this component as `(missing)`.\n\n**2. Connecting Principle (The \"Why It Matters\"):**\n*   **Definition:** A statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge. It provides the established biological context or mechanism needed to understand the significance of the Premise.\n*   **Identifiers:** Mechanisms from literature (\"Protein X regulates Pathway Y `(Ref: 12)`\") or general biological facts (\"The methionine cycle generates SAM\").\n*   **Constraint:** This is the \"lens\" through which the new finding is interpreted.\n*   **Implicitness:** If the biological mechanism or background knowledge is assumed to be known by the reader and not explicitly written, mark this component as `(missing)`.\n\n**3. Interpretation (The \"What It Means\") - FIND THIS FIRST:**\n*   **Definition:** The novel conclusion, testable hypothesis, or new mechanistic explanation that emerges from combining the Premise with the Connecting Principle.\n*   **Identifiers:** Look for forward-looking or inferential language: \"Therefore, we hypothesized...\", \"These findings suggest that...\", \"This indicates that...\", \"A prediction based on this hypothesis is...\", \"Collectively, these data show...\".\n*   **Constraint:** This IS NOT the experiment itself; it is the *meaning* derived from the experiment. This component must be explicit.\n\n**Search Strategy:**\nTo successfully identify these arguments, you must analyze the text subsection by subsection. For each subsection, follow this specific order of operations:\n1.  **IDENTIFY THE INTERPRETATION FIRST.** Look for the conclusion, hypothesis, or inference. This component is the \"anchor\" of the argument and will always be explicit in the text.\n2.  **Work Backwards.** Once you have isolated the interpretation, look immediately preceding it (or within the logical flow of the paragraph) to find the **Premise** (the specific data) and the **Connecting Principle** (the biological rule) that led to that conclusion.\n3.  **Assess Presence.** If a component (Premise or Connecting Principle) is not explicitly stated in the text\u2014whether it is understood from context, implied, or simply missing\u2014mark that specific component as `(implicit)`.\n\n**Extraction Rules:**\n*   **Verbatim Extraction:** For explicit text, extract it exactly as it appears in the document.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The components do not need to be contiguous sentences, but they must form a coherent logical unit.\n*   **Implicit/Missing Content:** If a component is not found explicitly, do **not** try to find the text elsewhere or summarize it. Simply write `(missing)`.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide the analysis **strictly** as a valid JSON array containing objects. Do not include any conversational text, introductory remarks, or explanations outside the JSON code block.\n\nUse the nested format below, grouping findings by their specific subsection header. IMPORTANT: If you cannot find any instances in a subsection, return an empty `triplets` array for that section.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"[Subsection Header Name]\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n        {\n            \"premise_finding\": \"[Verbatim text OR `(missing)`]\",\n            \"connecting_principle\": \"[Verbatim text OR `(missing)`]\",\n            \"interpretation\": \"[Verbatim text of the hypothesis/conclusion]\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"premise_finding\": \"...\",\n            \"connecting_principle\": \"...\",\n            \"interpretation\": \"...\"\n        }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"[Next Subsection Header Name]\",\n    \"triplets\": []\n  }\n]\n```\n\nExamples for a list of triplets:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"premise_finding\": \"Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a+/+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

{"request_id": 2, "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze the provided scientific paper excerpt as a scientific editor, specifically looking for three-part logical arguments in the Results section. The components are Premise (the finding), Connecting Principle (established knowledge), and Interpretation (the conclusion or hypothesis). I need to extract these triplets from each subsection of the Results.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each subsection in the Results section one by one. For each, I need to find the Interpretation first, then work backwards to find the Premise and Connecting Principle. \n\nStarting with the first subsection: \"Subsection: Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\". The Results here describe experiments where enhancers were replaced, leading to loss of Shh expression. The key Interpretation here is probably the conclusion that these enhancers can't act over long distances. Let me check the text. The last part says \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features... all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\" So the Interpretation is that the enhancers lack long-range activity. The Premise is the experimental result where replacing ZRS with these enhancers caused loss of Shh expression and truncated limbs. The Connecting Principle would be the established knowledge that enhancers can act over long distances, but here they don't. Wait, the paper mentions in the Introduction that some enhancers act over megabases, but here the results show that these specific ones can't. The Connecting Principle might be that enhancers usually can act over long distances, but in this case, they can't. But the user's instruction says the Connecting Principle is a pre-existing knowledge that bridges the Premise and Interpretation. So maybe the established knowledge is that enhancers can act over long distances, but the authors found that these specific ones can't. The Connecting Principle here would be the existing understanding that enhancers can act over long ranges. Then the Interpretation is that the tested enhancers can't. So the triplet would be: Premise is the experimental results (loss of Shh expression and limb phenotypes), Connecting Principle is the existing knowledge about enhancers acting over long distances, and Interpretation is the conclusion that these enhancers can't. But wait, the user says the Connecting Principle is the established biological context that explains why the Premise matters. So maybe the Connecting Principle is the idea that enhancers can act over long distances, and the Premise is that these specific ones don't, leading to the Interpretation that there's something missing in these enhancers. Hmm, perhaps the Connecting Principle is that enhancers can act over long distances, but in this case, the Premise (the enhancers not acting) leads to the Interpretation that there's a need for a REX element. But in this subsection, the Interpretation is just that the enhancers can't act at long range. So maybe the Connecting Principle is missing here because it's implied. Wait, the user says if it's implicit, mark as (missing). Let me check the text again. The authors state their results indicate that these enhancers lack long-range activity. The existing knowledge would be that some enhancers do act over long distances, but these don't. So the Connecting Principle is the established knowledge about long-range enhancers. The text does mention in the Introduction that some enhancers act over megabases, so the Connecting Principle is there. So the triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Replacing ZRS with these enhancers resulted in loss of Shh expression and truncated limbs.\nConnecting Principle: Enhancers can act over long distances (from literature).\nInterpretation: These enhancers lack long-range activity.\n\nBut the user wants the Connecting Principle to be a statement from the literature. The paper's Introduction says \"some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range (Ref: 1).\" So the authors are using that as the existing knowledge. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is that some enhancers can act over long distances, but the Premise is that these specific ones can't, leading to the Interpretation that they lack long-range activity.\n\nNext subsection: \"Subsection: Transplanted enhancers are accessible\". The results here show that the enhancers are accessible when transplanted. The Interpretation is that the inability to activate Shh is due to limitations in genomic interaction range. The Premise is that the transplanted enhancers are accessible. The Connecting Principle is that enhancer activity requires not just accessibility but also interaction with the promoter. So the existing knowledge is that enhancer-promoter interaction is necessary for activity. The authors mention in the Introduction that enhancers come into proximity to activate promoters, so the Connecting Principle would be that enhancer-promoter interaction is required. Therefore, the triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Transplanted enhancers are accessible (ATAC-seq results).\nConnecting Principle: Enhancer-promoter interaction is required for activation.\nInterpretation: The inability to activate Shh is due to limited interaction range.\n\nThird subsection: \"Subsection: The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\". The results show that HS72 can activate Shh when close. The Interpretation is that HS72 can activate Shh at short range. The Premise is the experimental result (LacZ expression and polydactyly). The Connecting Principle is that enhancer-promoter distance affects activity. The authors might be using the existing knowledge that enhancers work in proximity. So the triplet would be:\n\nPremise: HS72 inserted near Shh promoter activates it.\nConnecting Principle: Enhancer-promoter proximity allows activation.\nInterpretation: HS72 can activate Shh at short range.\n\nFourth subsection: \"Subsection: REX is required for long-range activation\". The authors find that adding REX allows long-range activation. The Interpretation is that REX is required for long-range activation. The Premise is that adding REX to HS72 in the ZRS position allows Shh expression. The Connecting Principle is that enhancer-promoter interaction is needed for long-range activation. The existing knowledge would be that enhancers need to interact with promoters. The triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Adding REX to HS72 allows long-range activation.\nConnecting Principle: Enhancer-promoter interaction is required.\nInterpretation: REX is necessary for long-range activation.\n\nFifth subsection: \"Subsection: REX is sufficient for long-range activation\". Here, adding REX to MM1492 allows long-range activation. The Interpretation is that REX is sufficient. The Premise is the experimental result. The Connecting Principle is that REX can extend enhancer range. The existing knowledge might be that enhancer elements can be modular. So the triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Adding REX to MM1492 allows long-range activation.\nConnecting Principle: Enhancer elements can be modular.\nInterpretation: REX is sufficient for long-range activation.\n\nSixth subsection: \"Subsection: LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\". The authors mutate LHX motifs and find loss of activity. The Interpretation is that LHX motifs are critical. The Premise is the mutagenesis results. The Connecting Principle is that TF motifs are important for enhancer activity. The existing knowledge is that TF binding sites are crucial for enhancer function. So the triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Mutating LHX motifs in REX disrupts long-range activation.\nConnecting Principle: TF motifs are critical for enhancer activity.\nInterpretation: LHX motifs in REX are critical for long-range activation.\n\nSeventh subsection: \"Subsection: LHX motifs are critical for ZRS activity\". The authors mutate ZRS motifs and see loss of long-range activity. The Interpretation is that LHX motifs are required for long-range ZRS activity. The Premise is the mutagenesis and rescue with REX. The Connecting Principle is that the same motifs are functionally equivalent. The existing knowledge is that TF motifs are important. The triplet would be:\n\nPremise: Mutating ZRS [C/T]AATTA motifs causes loss of long-range activity, which is rescued by REX.\nConnecting Principle: TF motifs are critical for enhancer activity.\nInterpretation: [C/T]AATTA motifs in ZRS are required for long-range activity.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these for the components as per the user's instructions. Make sure the Interpretation is explicit in the text, the Premise is the specific finding, and the Connecting Principle is the established knowledge. Also, if any component is missing, mark it as (missing). For example, in the first subsection, the Connecting Principle is the existing knowledge that enhancers can act over long distances, which is cited in the Introduction. So the triplet should include that. The user wants the verbatim text for each component where possible. Let me extract the exact quotes.\n\nFor the first subsection, the Interpretation is: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features... all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\" The Premise is the experimental results: replacing ZRS with these enhancers led to loss of Shh and truncated limbs. The Connecting Principle is the existing knowledge that enhancers can act over long distances (Ref: 1 in the Abstract). So the Connecting Principle is stated in the Introduction as \"some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range (Ref: 1).\" Therefore, the triplet would have the Connecting Principle as that statement.\n\nBut in the JSON output, the user wants the verbatim text. So the Connecting Principle should be the exact text from the paper. However, the user's example shows that the Connecting Principle is a statement from the literature. So in this case, the authors reference that some enhancers can act over long distances. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is \"some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range (Ref: 1)\" from the Abstract. But in the Results section, the authors are using this as the existing knowledge. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is that statement. However, in the JSON, the user wants the verbatim text from the paper. But in the Results section, the authors don't restate that; they just refer to it in their interpretation. Wait, the user's instruction says the Connecting Principle is a statement of pre-existing knowledge that is a logical bridge. So if the authors don't explicitly state the existing knowledge in the Results section but refer to it in the Interpretation, then the Connecting Principle is missing here. Because in the Results, the authors don't state the existing knowledge explicitly in that subsection. The existing knowledge is in the Introduction or Abstract. Therefore, in the Results section, the Connecting Principle might be missing because it's not restated there. The user's instruction says if it's not explicitly stated in the text (the subsection), mark it as (missing). So in the first subsection, the Connecting Principle is not explicitly stated in the Results, so it's (missing). Wait, but the authors do mention in the Results that the enhancers lack long-range activity, which is in contrast to established knowledge. However, the existing knowledge is not explicitly stated in the Results subsection. So the Connecting Principle is (missing) here. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The user's instruction says the Connecting Principle is a statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge. If the authors don't state that in the Results subsection but refer to it in their Interpretation, then it's (missing). For example, in the first triplet, the authors' Interpretation is that these enhancers can't act at long range. The existing knowledge is that some can, but the authors don't state that in the Results. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is (missing) here. But the user's example shows that the Connecting Principle can be a statement from the literature cited in the paper. So maybe the authors reference the existing knowledge in their Interpretation. Let me check the text again. The first Interpretation is: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features... all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\" The authors don't explicitly state the existing knowledge in the Results subsection. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is (missing) here. However, the user's example includes a Connecting Principle that is a statement from the literature. So maybe in this case, the authors are using the existing knowledge from the Introduction, but since it's not stated in the Results, it's (missing). Therefore, the first triplet would have (missing) for the Connecting Principle. \n\nThis seems to be a challenge. The user's instruction says to look for the Connecting Principle in the text of the subsection. If it's not there, mark as (missing). So in the first subsection, the authors don't state the existing knowledge in the Results; they just present the findings and then the Interpretation. Therefore, the Connecting Principle is (missing). \n\nSimilarly, in the next subsections, if the authors don't state the existing knowledge in the Results, it's (missing). \n\nSo, for example, in the first subsection:\n\nPremise_finding: Replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud and truncated limb phenotypes indistinguishable from ZRS replacement with a nonfunctional control sequence.\n\ninterpretation: These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features... all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\n\nconnecting_principle: (missing)\n\nBecause the existing knowledge about enhancers acting over long distances is in the Introduction, not in the Results subsection. So the Connecting Principle is (missing).\n\nThis seems to be the case for most triplets in the Results. The authors present their findings and then their Interpretation, but the Connecting Principle (the existing knowledge) is not explicitly stated in the Results subsection but is referenced in the Introduction. Therefore, in the JSON, the Connecting Principle would be (missing) for each triplet.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided by the user, the Connecting Principle is a statement from the literature that is explicitly stated in the text. For example, in the example triplet, the Connecting Principle is a statement about DNMT3A mutations and hypomethylation. So if the authors don't state the existing knowledge in the Results, it's (missing). \n\nTherefore, in the first subsection, the triplet would have:\n\npremise_finding: \"Replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud and truncated limb phenotypes indistinguishable from ZRS replacement with a nonfunctional control sequence.\"\n\ninterpretation: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features... all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\"\n\nconnecting_principle: (missing)\n\nBecause the existing knowledge is not stated in the Results subsection.\n\nSimilarly, for other subsections, if the authors don't state the existing knowledge in the Results, the Connecting Principle is (missing). \n\nNow, let's proceed to extract each triplet accordingly.\n", "response": "\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\":

mediates long-distance enhancer activity\n\n## Abstract\n\nAlthough most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range(Ref: 1). The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh(Ref: 2). The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis-acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals(Ref: 3-7). Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances (Ref: 1,2,8-10). Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer(Ref: 8,11-14). A central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood (Ref: 1,15). Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs)(Ref: 16-20). However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF-and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression (Ref: 21-25). Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs(Ref: 26-31). Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood(Ref: 1,13,15,32). Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation. Here we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively abolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\n\nTo test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2). Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb(Ref: 33). Owing to the clear phenotypic readout and lack of redundancy, ZRS-Shh is an ideal locus for assessing the long-range enhancer activity of transplanted enhancers. To perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression in the developing limb bud mesenchyme (MM1492 and MM1564 (from mouse) and HS1516 and HS72 (from human); Fig. 1a,b). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA, a posterior domain of the limb mesenchyme where ZRS activates Shh gene expression (Fig. 1b). All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by acetylation at lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27ac) in limb buds, a histone modification that is associated with active enhancers (Fig. 1a). To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) multiome profiling of 14,000 cells from a wild-type (WT) embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) hindlimb bud (Methods). After clustering all 14,000 cells on the basis of their chromatin and gene expression profiles, we annotated 16 clusters representing all major cell types in the developing limb bud (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers display strong DNA accessibility in Shh positive ZPA cells, consistent with their ability to drive robust reporter expression in posterior limb mesenchyme in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 1a). To link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, we used the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from multiome profiling and E-P physical interaction data based on tissue-resolved high-resolution enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Methods). We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (mouse homologue of HS1516) (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (mouse homologue of HS72) (411 kb away) (Fig. 1c). We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos. This analysis confirmed the above E-P links and additionally identified Rbms1 as a putative target for MM1564 (177 kb away; Fig. 1b,c). We next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology in E18.5 KI mice. Consistent with the loss of limb-specific Shh expression, all four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. The limb phenotypes were indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence of similar length (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Transplanted enhancers lack long-range limb activity in KI mice. a, For each limb enhancer (coloured blocks), pseudobulk ZPA scATAC-seq, E11.5 forelimb H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)(Ref: 69) and placental conservation tracks are shown. mHS72 and mHS1516 are the mouse homologues of the HS72 and HS1516 enhancers. b, The corresponding enhancer activities in transgenic E11.5 mouse embryos.

To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC-seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 KI alleles. HS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC-seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.\n\n### Subsection: The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\n\nThe inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising, given their robust enhancer features and ability to establish open chromatin at the transplanted location. Previously, all four limb enhancers were characterized in transgenic mice using a well-established hsp68 minimal promoter, but their compatibility with the Shh promoter is unclear. To test whether E-P incompatibility(Ref: 36,37) could have a role in the observed differences in gene activation, we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct into fertilized mouse eggs. All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZexpression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter(Ref: 38-40). To test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41). As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity(Ref: 42) (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72::Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Importantly, ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Transplanted enhancers maintain open chromatin structure and drive functional Shh expression in the limb at short range. a, Allele-specific ZPA ATAC-seq profiles at the transplanted HS1516 (green box) and HS72 (orange box) enhancers and the corresponding WT ZRS locus (top).

Scale bars, 1 mm (b (left) and c) and 250 \u00b5m (b, right).\n\n### Subsection: REX is required for long-range activation\n\nThe HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter and is accessible when transplanted in place of the ZRS (Fig. 2) suggesting that its failure to activate Shh remotely could be due to the extreme distance from the Shh promoter. Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig. 1c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig. 1c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig. 3a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs. 1b and 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig. 3b). Consistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs. 1b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). Notably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.\n\n### Subsection: REX is sufficient for long-range activation\n\nTo test whether the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers, we generated a KI mouse line in which the ZRS was replaced with a chimeric element consisting of the shortest-range heterologous limb enhancer from our test set (MM1492, 73 kb native E-P range) appended by the REX element (MM1492 + REX; Extended Data Fig. 5d). KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e). These mice also displayed polydactyly, consistent with broad limb activity of MM1492. Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation. These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.\n\n> Fig. 3 | The REX element is necessary and sufficient for long-range activation of Shh by a heterologous limb enhancer. a, An evolutionary conserved element of unknown function is located adjacent to the human HS72 enhancer.

The stars indicate extra digits (polydactyly). Hindlimb Shh expression analysis is provided in Extended Data Fig. 5. Scale bars, 1 mm (c (left) and b and d (right)), 500 \u00b5m (b and d, middle) and 250 \u00b5m (c, right).\n\n### Subsection: LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\n\nTo identify specific TFs that may be involved in REX-mediated long-range enhancer action, we examined potential TF-binding sites within the REX element. The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig. 6j). We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). To determine the importance of LHX and LEF1 motifs for REX function, we generated two KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with the extended HS72 sequence containing the REX element with either the single LEF1 motif or both LHX motifs mutagenized. Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly indicating that disruption of the LEF1 motif does not abolish long-range activity of the REX element (Fig. 4b). However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus. To investigate whether the LHX or other TF motifs are present at long-range limb enhancers, we used a collection of experimentally validated limb enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a unique resource of human and mouse enhancers with in vivo activities characterized in transgenic mice(Ref: 43). We linked these bona fide limb enhancers to their putative target genes using the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from our single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq experiment or E-P physical interactions from enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1d). We next performed motif analysis of these limb enhancers. We found 33 motifs that match the binding preferences of limb-expressed TFs that are significantly enriched in long-range acting (173 regions; E-P distance, 400 kb to 2 Mb) compared to short-range acting (28 regions; E-P distance, 10-200 kb) enhancer regions (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P<1\u00d710-2 and target frequency > 30%), with LHX2 and LHX9 being among the most significantly enriched (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, HD TFs with a similar [C/T]AATTA consensus binding preference, including DLX5, MSX2 and SHOX2, comprised 10 out of these 33 motifs. By contrast, short-range limb enhancers showed no enrichment for TF motifs over long-range enhancers. We next examined all 19,276 limb mesenchyme E-P pairs predicted from our scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq experiment (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 2). Genome wide, the LHX2 motif was among the most significantly enriched in long-range versus short-range limb enhancers (CT\u0410\u0410\u0422\u0422\u0410, P < 6 \u00d7 10-32). Overall, [C/T]AATTA HD motifs, including both LHX2 and LHX9 motifs, comprised 15 out of the top 20 most significantly enriched motifs in long-range limb enhancers. The REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long range enhancer activity (Fig. 4a,c). To test whether having more than one [C/T] AATTA motif could be characteristic of other long-range enhancers, we examined the number of [C/T]AATTA motifs in experimentally validated and multiome-predicted limb enhancers (Methods). Indeed, for limb enhancers containing more than one [C/T]AATTA motif the enhancer regions were on average 429 kb farther (median distance) from their target promoters than other limb enhancers (P<0.01; Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6f-i). Taken together, these results indicate that conserved [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are enriched in long-distance limb enhancers throughout the genome and are frequently located within the conserved core of enhancers themselves (Extended Data Fig. 6k).\n\n> Fig. 4 | The REX element contains conserved LHX motifs that are critical for its function and globally linked to long-range regulation. a, The position and evolutionary conservation of predicted TF motifs within the REX element.

Scale bars, 1 mm (b and c).\n\n### Subsection: LHX motifs are critical for ZRS activity\n\nWe next examined whether [C/T]AATTA motifs located inside enhancers are specifically required for their long-range enhancer activity. The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig. 5a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse(Ref: 44). We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRSAHD), drives eGFP. The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig. 5a). We injected the resulting ZRS-mCherry/ZRSAHD-eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). We obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig. 5c). While both the ZRS and ZRSAHD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRSAHD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity(Ref: 45). Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP, indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation (P < 0.0182; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Having established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E-P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRSAHD/AHD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSAHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity. These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances. Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T]AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\n\n> Fig. 5 | [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are required for long-range gene activation. a, The position of previously identified TF-binding sites within the mouse ZRS core (chromosome 5: 29314881-29315667; mm10)(Ref: 45,70).

The structure they're looking for is Premise (their finding), Connecting Principle (existing knowledge), and Interpretation (new conclusion or hypothesis).\n\nFirst, I need to go through the Results section subsection by subsection. The user provided the Results section with several subsections like \"NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\" and \"Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\". For each of these, I need to look for the Interpretation first, then find the Premise and Connecting Principle that support it.\n\nStarting with the first subsection: \"NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\". The Interpretation here might be something like the conclusion that tumour-associated myelopoiesis primes pathways in BM GMPs. The Premise would be the specific data they found, like increased motif accessibility for NFE2L2. The Connecting Principle could be a known fact about NRF2's role in stress response.\n\nNext, in the subsection \"Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\", the Interpretation could be that exposure to tumour cues affects mo-mac trajectory. The Premise would be the adoptive transfer experiment showing more immunoregulatory mo-macs from tumour-primed GMPs. The Connecting Principle might be that myeloid progenitors' environment influences their differentiation.\n\nI need to make sure each component is correctly identified. The Premise must be from the current study, not a citation. The Connecting Principle is existing knowledge, and the Interpretation is the new conclusion. Also, if a component is missing, I should note it as (missing). \n\nI'll go through each paragraph in the Results section, identify the Interpretation first, then work backward to find the Premise and Connecting Principle. For example, in the \"NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis\" subsection, the Interpretation might be that NRF2 activation is crucial for immunosuppression. The Premise could be the reduced tumour burden in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice. The Connecting Principle would be the known role of NRF2 in cytoprotection.\n\nI have to be careful not to include citations in the Premise.

immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours\n\n## Abstract\n\nMonocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Ref: 1) and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2). Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T cell and/or natural killer cell responses (Ref: 3). Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the \u2018wellspring\u2019 of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 2,4). Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8), but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour\u2013host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies. Here we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nTo characterize the impact of lung adenocarcinoma growth on myelopoiesis, we profiled progenitors and myeloid lineages in BM of naive and KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl (KP) tumour-bearing mice modelling non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at early (day 7), middle (day 15) and advanced (day 21) time points. We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic\u2013monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a). BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic\u2013monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). In addition, we observed an increased mobilization of Ly6Chi monocytes and Ly6Ghi neutrophils in circulation tracking with tumour burden (Extended Data Figs. 1d and 2b). We also observed an expansion of GMP-derived CD157+Ly6Chi neutrophil-like monocytes in the BM and peripheral blood of late-stage tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1b), previously described to expand in emergency conditions and engender oxidative burst-associated degranulation gene programs (Ref: 9,10). We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in the KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig. 2c).\nGiven that such myeloid expansion is driven by malignancy, we probed how molecular programs are transcriptionally and epigenetically rewired in myeloid progenitors in response to peripheral tumour cues. Experimentally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate myeloid progenitor lineages broadly sorted from the BM of age-matched naive and advanced tumour-bearing mice (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We identified distinct granulocytic (granulocytic progenitor, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil) and monocytic (cMoP, Ly6Chi monocyte, Ly6Clow monocyte) lineages (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 2). We focused on monocytic lineage progenitors (GMP and cMoP) because they are the main source of suppressive mo-macs in tumours (Ref: 11). Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as \u2018response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2019, \u2018hypoxia response\u2019, \u2018regulation of apoptosis\u2019 and \u2018metabolic regulation of superoxide generation\u2019, which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\nUsing scRNA-seq profiles of myeloid cells with paired small-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we then correlated gene programs in each myeloid cell state to chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 1i) and focused on transcription factors (TF) driving downstream gene programs. Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions included GATA2, TAL1 and LYL1 (Ref: 14), whereas cMoPs and monocyte marker regions were enriched in IRF4 and SPIB (Ref: 15) (Extended Data Fig. 1j). We then sought to identify TF motifs enriched in differentially accessible regions of tumour-associated cell states. In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as NFE2L2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (Ref: 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA (Ref: 17) (Fig. 1e), when compared with naive counterparts. These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1k). Enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal augmented in tumour-associated GMPs was associated with pathways involved in cellular detoxification, immunoregulation and anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways (Extended Data Fig. 1l). Domains of regulatory chromatin (DORC) scores calculated on H3K4me3 signal\u2013gene association highlighted genes involved in inflammation regulation (for example, S100a8, S100a9, Hif1a, Chil3, Lcn2 and Prtn3), metabolic adaptation under oxidative stress (for example, Hk3, Eif5a, Pkm, Gpi1, Gsr and Aldh2) and mitogen-induced survival (for example, Anxa3, Tnfrsf1a and Serpinb1a) activated in KP-experienced GMPs (Fig. 1g and Methods). On the other hand, we observed a reduction of type I or III interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression in tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors, supporting a dampened inflammatory state (Ref: 18,19) distal to the TME (Fig. 1c). The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs including IRF3, IRF7, IRF5 and STAT2 (Fig. 1e), lower H3K4me3-associated DORC scores at IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) loci such as Ifi203, Oasl1 and Isg15 (Fig. 1g) and lower H3K4me1-associated and H3K27ac-associated DORC scores complemented by higher H3K27me3 repressive histone mark at gene loci such as Ifitm3, Ms4a4c, Mx1 and Gbp4 in tumoural BM myeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 1m) further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity. These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22). We identified certain binding motifs for TFs such as Nfe2l2 to be enriched in promoter-proximal activating histone marks of tumoural myeloid progenitors, unlike TFs such as Gata2, Mesp1, Glis2 and Tcf3 that are enriched at more distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enhancer-associated signal (Extended Data Fig. 1n).\nSubsequently, we quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC and found that HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC when compared with healthy donors (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2e). We next conducted a 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with NSCLC, to interrogate molecular changes. Mirroring our findings in mice, CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood of patients with early NSCLC had increased oxidative stress response signature scores (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1o) and accessible chromatin topics enriched in these patients were associated with \u2018MAPK signalling activation\u2019, \u2018metabolic processes\u2019, \u2018response to ROS\u2019 and \u2018response to oxidative stress\u2019 (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 1p). In support, genes differentially expressed in monocytes from patients with NSCLC were downstream of TF regulators such as NFE2L2, STAT3, PPARG and MYC (Extended Data Fig. 1q). Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Lung cancer influences chromatin state of BM myeloid progenitors.\na, Relative abundance of LT-HSC, CMP, GMP and cMoP in BM of KP tumour-bearing mice at different time points, normalized to tumour-naive mice.

We found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). In addition, we differentiated BM-derived macrophage (BMDM) ex vivo in the presence of tumour conditioning (CM) either early or later during the differentiation. Early exposure to tumour inflammatory cues significantly enhanced mo-mac suppressive phenotype compared with late exposure (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Transient incubation of BM progenitors with KP CM also cued a more immunoregulatory phenotype in progeny macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\nUsing paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis of myeloid cells isolated from naive and tumour-bearing lungs (Extended Data Fig. 2g), we identified discrete inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes, patrolling Ly6Clow monocytes, resident tissue alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and mo-mac subsets such as ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Using gene\u2013gene correlation, we identified a module of genes implicated in anti-apoptotic cytoprotection, glycolytic metabolic shift and regulation of oxidative stress that was highly enriched in tumour-infiltrating ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods), regulated by TFs such as STAT3, NFE2L2, HIF1A, KLF4, SPI1 and CEBPB. We captured a similar diversity of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the scATAC-seq data through independent clustering of chromatin accessibility features (Extended Data Fig. 4c), which aligned with cell-type-specific enrichment of lineage-determining TF motifs (Extended Data Fig. 4d). TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs. Phenotypically, Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 3g). In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\nWe simultaneously used paired single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling to analyse tumour-infiltrating immune cells isolated from 14 human NSCLC lesions (Supplementary Table 3). On the basis of marker gene-based filtering in our 10x Multiome dataset from 5 patients, we isolated 4,177 myeloid cells and classified them according to their nuclear RNA-seq profiles and by weighted gene correlation network analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells included CD14+ monocyte clusters, a transitional mo-mac state that exhibits monocytic features and macrophage markers such as MRC1, CD68 and C1QA; SPP1hi mo-macs (Ref: 25) characterized by SPP1, FBP1 and IL4I1; and TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 26) characterized by GPNMB, CD9, TREM2 and PPARG (Extended Data Fig. 4f and modules in Supplementary Table 4). We integrated the cellular identity from Multiome samples with 24,346 scATAC-seq-captured myeloid cells from 9 patients (Extended Data Fig. 4g). In close agreement with our mouse analyses, we observed motifs for TFs such as NFE2L2, FOSL2, JUN and BACH1 to be enriched in marker peaks of tumour-infiltrating activated CD14+ monocytes, mo-mac_transition and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4h).\nSubsequently, we prioritized TF regulators with sustained cell-type specific activity in TME-infiltrating immunosuppressive mo-macs. Putative TF regulators in our mouse dataset included Spi1, Mafb and Cebpb, as well as NF-\u03baB or Rel family members and AP-1 family members associated with response to inflammation and growth factors (Ref: 27) (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Strikingly, we again observed a nexus of stress-responsive TFs, principally Nfe2l2, Bach1, Fosl2, Mafk and Mafg. Concurrent analyses in our human NSCLC dataset of TME monocytes and mo-macs indicated very similar candidate regulators such as NFKB1, REL, SPIB and CEBPB but also oxidative stress response and integrated stress response regulators NFE2L2, BACH1, MAFF, FOSL2 and ATF4 (Fig. 2b). Downstream pathways conserved across mouse and human TME mo-macs included \u2018heme signalling\u2019, \u2018cytoprotection by HMOX1\u2019, \u2018response to ER stress\u2019 and \u2018mitochondrial biogenesis\u2019 (Extended Data Fig. 4j) and ranking on the basis of correlation to gene expression prioritized NFKB1, REL, CEBPB, CEBPG and NFE2L2 (Fig. 2c).\n\n> Fig. 2 | Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels mo-macs in TME with sustained cytoprotective stress response. a, In vivo tracing of naive (n = 3) and KP tumour-primed (n = 5) BM GMPs sorted at day 17 and transferred to KP tumour-bearing CD45.1 hosts, with frequency of donor-derived CD45.2+ TREM2hi, ARG1hi and CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs, and frequency of donor-derived CD45.2+TREM2hi mo-macs expressing PD-L1 four days post transfer.

NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33). In the lung, we observed relative TF motif deviation for NRF2 and aggregate score for NRF2 downstream gene activation to be highest in immunoregulatory ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs that accumulate in late-stage tumours (Ref: 34) (Fig. 2d). We did not rely on Nfe2l2 gene expression alone, because NRF2 is regulated post-transcriptionally and post-translationally. As a proxy for activation of NRF2 programs in vivo, we assayed the amounts of nuclear NRF2 and intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1, encoded by Hmox1) (Ref: 35). TREM2hi mo-macs had increased amounts of NRF2 and HO-1 compared with CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in KP tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3h), and mo-macs in KP GEMM also had increased amounts of NRF2 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similarly, in human NSCLC, NRF2 TF motif deviation was highest in immunosuppressive TREM2hi mo-macs and recently infiltrated monocytes (mo-mac_transition), with concomitantly high NRF2 downstream gene activation (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, we found the NRF2 activation score to be highest in tumour-associated TREM2hi mo-macs across two independent scRNA-seq datasets (Ref: 36,37) (Extended Data Fig. 3i and Methods).\nGiven the persistent NRF2 pathway activation in TME immunosuppressive mo-macs, we next explored when NRF2 was activated during GMP differentiation to monocytes and mo-macs. We observed increased NRF2 activation and HO-1 induction in mo-macs that differentiate in vivo from adoptively transferred tumour-experienced BM GMPs, and myeloid progenitors exposed to early transient tumour conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). GMPs isolated from KP tumour-bearing mice had increased H3K4me3 promoter-proximal signal at known NRF2 oxidative stress response genes such as Gclm, Alas1, Gsr, Prtn3 and Txnrd1 (Extended Data Fig. 3l), but also key immunosuppressive gene loci such as Cebpb, Ptgs1 (Ref. 38), Inhba (Ref: 39), Lcn2 (Ref. 40) and S100a8 (Ref. 41) (Fig. 2f), suggesting imprinting of immunoregulatory programs early in differentiation. Crucially, although we observed tumour-educated BM GMPs and monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility compared with their tumour-free counterparts, this was not matched by activation of downstream gene programs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Given the downregulation of the IFN-stimulated response in tumour-experienced BM myeloid cells, we next tested the temporal relationship of IFN responsiveness with NRF2 activation. For this, we implanted lung tumours in Mx1GFP IFN-sensitive response element reporter mice (Ref: 42). Here tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Strikingly, there was a stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Several ISGs and antigen-presentation-associated gene loci are potentially regulated by NRF2 and partner TFs at distal enhancer loci, as evident from reduced H3K27ac CUT&RUN marks in KP-experienced GMPs at loci such as Mx1, Ifitm1, Slamf7 and H2-Ab1 (Extended Data Fig. 5e). These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\n\nTaking a candidate approach to identify cues that activate NRF2, we found protein factors to be the dominant trigger in tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Specifically, factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin 6 were enriched in BM sera, blood sera and tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f). GM-CSF and interleukin 6 mimicked the impact of tumour CM on myelopoiesis, resulting in NRF2 activation, increased HO-1 expression and increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). The myelopoietic effects of KP CM were ameliorated by incubating progenitors with anti-GM-CSF and anti-interleukin 6 neutralizing antibodies, associated with a reduction in oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j). Although there was a reduction in myeloid expansion and HO-1 expression upon incubating progenitors with KP CM in the presence of ML385\u2014an inhibitor of Nfe2l2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Ref: 43) (Extended Data Fig. 6k)\u2014there was an increase in oxidative burden (Extended Data Fig. 6l) suggestive of stress response uncoupling. We found that stress-responsive p38 MAPK signalling was induced in KP CM-experienced progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 6m) but was not affected by ML385 (Extended Data Fig. 6n); this suggested NRF2 pathway activation to be downstream of stress-responsive signal transduction from mitogenic cues such as GM-CSF and interleukin 6. Incubating progenitors with GM-CSF and interleukin 6 in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitor ameliorated myelopoietic expansion as well as HO-1 expression in conjunction with reducing cellular ROS burden (Extended Data Fig. 6o,p). Although we do not exclude other signals in the TME such as heme (Ref: 44), our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand (Extended Data Fig. 6q).\n\n### Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\n\nHaving established the role of NRF2 in BM myeloid expansion, we interrogated the functional consequence of NRF2 in tumour-associated myeloid cell survival and immunosuppression. Exposing BMDMs to tumour CM during the last 24 h of culture (to mimic polarization in the TME) resulted in immunosuppressive gene activation, cytoprotection and IFN response suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7a). When we cultured BMDMs from NRF2 constitutive knockout mice (Nfe2l2TKO) or wild-type counterparts in the presence of KP CM, we found that tumour-conditioned Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had lower relative activation of Arg1, Retnla and Chil3, while concomitantly expressing higher amounts of the ISGs Mx1 and Nos2 (Fig. 3a). Adding ML385 at day 6 resulted in a similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Remarkably, tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs exhibited increased ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial stress, and increased sensitivity to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). This susceptibility for cell death under redox crisis was specific to tumour condition, because Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs did not exhibit increased cell death at steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Viable tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had reduced expression of HO-1, ARG1 and PD-L1 with increased expression of MHCII, CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 3b), indicating a phenotypic shift towards immunogenicity and antigen presentation.\nNext, we generated conditional knockout mice, wherein NRF2 is floxed by Cre recombinase under the Ms4a3 promoter (Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3) restricted to GMPs (Ref: 45), resulting in decreased NRF2 activity. Myelopoiesis, differentiation and monocyte function in these mice were unaltered at the steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7f\u2013i). We adoptively transferred GMPs from CD45.2 Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 or Nfe2l2fl/fl control BM into congenic CD45.1 hosts bearing KP tumours, and found that GMPs from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs and strikingly fewer TREM2hi mo-macs in the lung TME, with the TREM2hi mo-macs having decreased PD-L1 (Fig. 3c). GMPs derived from KP-experienced mice treated with quassinoid NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol (Ref: 46), when similarly transferred into congenic tumour-bearing mice, differentiated into more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 3d). Remarkably, GMPs from tumour-naive mice administered antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) differentiated into mo-macs with increased immunosuppressive phenotype (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 7j). Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\n\n> Fig. 3 | NRF2 signalling is a regulator of mo-mac persistence and immunosuppressive function in the lung TME. a, Gene expression in KP CM-exposed Nfe2l2TKO (KO) BMDMs as measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomatoMs4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 3e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and Nfe2l2fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 8b). We also generated transgenic mice, wherein the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) locus was floxed under Ms4a3Cre (Keap1\u0394Ms4a3) resulting in GMP-restricted loss of KEAP1, a component of the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex controlling the stability of NRF2, leading to sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice when compared with littermates (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We next assessed myelopoiesis in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice. Although NRF2 deletion did not affect steady-state myelopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g), tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had significant contraction of BM CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig. 4b). Reduced NRF2 in tumoural mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice was associated with a reduction in the number of PD-L1-expressing TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME and a compensatory increase in CD86+MHCII+ immunogenic mo-macs (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice were more susceptible to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 8d), providing rationale for the phenotypic shift in the TME. The mo-mac distribution in Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice was tumour-promoting, with more abundant TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME expressing PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).\nTo measure the cell-intrinsic effect of NRF2 activation on myelopoiesis independent of tumour burden differences, we created mixed-BM chimeras with 1:1 reconstitution of CD45.2 Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and CD45.1 Nfe2l2WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f). We observed decreased expansion of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 donor-derived GMPs in BM and lower mobilization of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Consequently in the lung, TREM2hi mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 origin were also relatively less abundant, whereas CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs were increased (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on the myeloid progenitor lineages in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice and control counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8i) showed the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) to be in GMPs and monocytic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 8j\u2013l). The GMP, cMoP and mature monocyte clusters in BM of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had reduced TF motif accessibility for Nfe2l2 and Bach1, Stat3, Myc, Myb, Fosl2 and Atf3 that drive important facets of myeloid differentiation, proliferation and survival (Ref: 47-49) (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8m). Type I or III IFN response regulators such as Irf3, Irf5 and Irf9 were enriched in DARs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mature Ly6Chi monocytes, matched by reduced accessibility for Hnf1a, Etv3 and Etv6 (Ref: 50) (Extended Data Fig. 8m). Downstream of BM progenitors, molecular programs in lung-infiltrating myeloid cells were significantly altered in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 8n,o). NRF2 activation scores were decreased in Ly6Chi monocytes from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice, with a concomitant upshift in IFN-responsive gene scores (Extended Data Fig. 8p). Specifically, there was relative enrichment of ISGs (Stat1, Rsad2, Ifit2, Isg20, Ifit3b) and antigen presentation genes (H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Mef2c) in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 TME-infiltrative monocytes and mo-macs, with a decrease in sensing pathways (Ier3, Tlr4, Cd38 and C3ar1), immunoregulatory genes (Chil3, Vcan, S100a8, Ngp, Lcn2, Arg1, Ptgs1 and Prtn3) and NRF2-associated cytoprotective genes (Gpx3, Gclm, Tfec and Ednrb) (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8q).\nTo disentangle how NRF2 affects local reprogramming in the TME from how it influences replenishment through myelopoiesis, we leveraged the tamoxifen-inducible strategy to generate Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice and conditionally ablate NRF2 signalling in myeloid precursors before or after tumour exposure. Tamoxifen administration from the time of KP tumour implantation (early) in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig. 4g). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4h), reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4i), but insignificant changes to neutrophil mobilization and tumoural infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling, as evidenced by reduced nuclear NRF2 in TME mo-macs, was associated with accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 4j,k). Reduced myeloid NRF2 signalling was associated with significant infiltration of tumoricidal IFN\u03b3+ natural killer cells into lung tumours (Extended Data Fig. 9c\u2013e). Effector CD8+ T cells were also more abundant in the tumours of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). Depletion of monocytes and mo-macs in KP tumour-bearing NRF2-proficient mice resulted in a clear reduction in tumour burden, signifying the importance of mo-macs in KP progression, but such treatment in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice saw no additive impact, suggesting NRF2 activation in mo-macs is crucial to orchestrating immunosuppression (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Furthermore, depletion of natural killer cells in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice resulted in greater tumour burden, highlighting the mode of immunoregulation in this model to be predominantly by means of natural killer cell exclusion and suppression (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 9i).\n\n> Fig. 4 | Targeting myeloid NRF2 pathway reprograms myelopoiesis and potentiates immunotherapy. a, KP tumour burden in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (n = 8) or Nfe2l2fl/fl littermates (n = 7). b, Relative abundance of LT-HSC, myeloid progenitors and mature populations in BM of tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (n = 6), normalized to Nfe2l2fl/fl littermates (n = 6). c, Nuclear NRF2 in tumour-infiltrating mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 6) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 6). d, Number of tumour-infiltrating TREM2hi mo-macs, CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 9) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 7), and TREM2hi mo-macs expressing PD-L1 in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 6) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 6). e, TF motifs differentially enriched in KP tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 GMP (left) and cMoP (right) compared with Nfe2l2fl/fl.

In three independent scRNA-seq datasets of immunotherapy or chemotherapy response comparing baseline with post-therapy tissue, tumour-infiltrating mo-macs enriched in non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013c and Methods), as well as circulating CD14+ monocytes in non-responders with stable disease (Extended Data Fig. 10d) had DEGs regulated by TFs such as PPARG, TP63, SMAD4 and NFE2L2. Spurred on by our observations, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade. We administered NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol with or without anti-PD-1 therapy starting at day 9 post-KP tumour implant. Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l), affected myelopoiesis as evidenced by the reduction of CMPs, GMPs and cMoPs (Fig. 4m), and reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4n). These systemic changes were associated with a decrease in the abundance of mo-macs, specific decrease in PD-L1+TREM2hi mo-macs and concomitant increase in CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs (Fig. 4o). Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e). A similar dosing regimen using ML385 in conjunction with anti-PD-1 had similarly improved outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 10f). We found the efficacy of combination therapy relied on targeting of myeloid NRF2, because administration of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3Cre mice had no additive impact on anti-tumour immunity (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Anti-tumour immunity was associated with a substantial influx of natural killer cells with increased expression of CD69 and tumoricidal IFN\u03b3 (Extended Data Fig. 10h), alongside effector CD8+ T cells lacking exhaustion marks, and producing IFN\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor (Extended Data Fig. 10i).\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"request_id": 4, "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's tackle this task. I need to analyze the provided scientific paper excerpt and identify the three-part logical arguments in the Results section. The structure is Premise (What We Found), Connecting Principle (Why It Matters), and Interpretation (What It Means). \n\nFirst, I'll go through each subsection in the Results section one by one. The user mentioned to start with the Interpretation, then work backwards to find Premise and Connecting Principle.\n\nStarting with the first subsection: \"Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\". The Results here mention that two clusters were identified based on metastatic potential. The key Interpretation here is probably the conclusion that there are two subsets with liver or lung avidity. Let me check the text. \n\nIn the paragraph, they say: \"Together, these results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1-Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2-Lung).\" That's the Interpretation. \n\nNow, the Premise would be their specific findings. They did high-throughput screens, calculated fractional seeding ratios, found two clusters. The experiments with cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, etc.) showed liver vs lung colonization. The Connecting Principle here is the existing knowledge about metastasis patterns in PDAC. The paper mentions that PDAC frequently metastasizes to liver and lungs, but the specific target organ affects outcomes. However, in the current paper's subsection, the Connecting Principle might be missing because they're establishing the model, not connecting to prior mechanisms. Wait, the first sentence of the Introduction mentions that PDAC metastasizes to liver and lungs. So maybe the Connecting Principle is that PDAC commonly metastasizes to these organs, which is established knowledge. But in the Results section, the authors are presenting their own data. The Interpretation is the conclusion that two subsets exist. The Premise is their data on the cell lines and experiments. The Connecting Principle might be missing here because they're not using a known mechanism but rather establishing the model.\n\nNext subsection: \"Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\". The Interpretation here is probably that the classical subtype is linked to lung metastasis and basal to liver. They found classical gene signatures in C2-Lung lines and liver avidity negative correlation. They did histological analysis and GATA6 staining. The Connecting Principle would be prior knowledge that PDAC can be stratified into basal and classical subtypes with different features. The Interpretation is that classical subtype is linked to lung. The Premise is their data on gene expression and staining. The Connecting Principle is the existing literature on PDAC subtypes. \n\nThird subsection: \"PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\". The Interpretation is that PCSK9 expression levels are linked to organ preference. The Premise is their gene expression correlation analysis showing PCSK9 as top enriched in C2-Lung, and the immunoblot data on LDLR and PCSK9. The Connecting Principle is the known function of PCSK9 in regulating LDLR. \n\nFourth subsection: \"PCSK9-low liver-avid cells uptake LDL-cholesterol\". The Interpretation here is that low PCSK9 allows LDL uptake, which is necessary for liver growth. The Premise is their experiments with Dil-LDL uptake, filipin staining, and LPDS culture. The Connecting Principle is the known role of LDLR in cholesterol uptake. \n\nFifth subsection: \"PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\". The Interpretation is that high PCSK9 leads to cholesterol synthesis in lung cells. The Premise is their data on cholesterol biosynthesis genes, CRISPR knockouts. The Connecting Principle is the existing knowledge that cholesterol synthesis is important when uptake is limited. \n\nNext, \"PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\". The Interpretation is that PCSK9 levels directly influence organ-specific growth. The Premise is their experiments with PCSK9 variants and knockout. The Connecting Principle might be the established role of cholesterol metabolism in organ adaptation. \n\n\"Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\": The Interpretation is that LDL-cholesterol supports mTORC1 and oxysterol production. The Premise is their data on mTORC1 activation, CYP46A1 expression. The Connecting Principle is the known role of lysosomal cholesterol in mTORC1 activation. \n\n\"Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells\": The Interpretation is that cholesterol intermediates protect against ferroptosis. The Premise is their metabolomics data on 7-DHC, resistance to RSL3. The Connecting Principle is the known link between cholesterol intermediates and ferroptosis resistance. \n\nNow, I need to structure each of these into the JSON format as per the user's instructions. For each subsection, identify the triplets. Some subsections might have multiple triplets. I need to make sure each triplet is correctly identified with the three components. Also, if a component is missing, mark it as (missing). \n\nFor example, in the first subsection, the Interpretation is the conclusion about the two subsets. The Premise is their data on the cell lines and experiments. The Connecting Principle might be the existing knowledge about PDAC metastasis patterns, but since the paper is in the Results section, maybe that's considered the Connecting Principle. However, the user's note says that the Connecting Principle is a pre-existing knowledge that acts as a bridge. So in the first subsection, the authors are establishing the model, so the Connecting Principle might be missing because they're not using prior mechanisms but rather presenting their own data to show the model. \n\nI need to go through each subsection carefully, extract the Interpretation first, then find the Premise and Connecting Principle. Let's start with the first subsection.\n", "response": "\n\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Our analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c).

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines (Ref: 2), in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates\u20147-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol\u2014with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site (Ref: 3). The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches (Ref: 1). Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive (Ref: 4). PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes (Ref: 5); however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread (Ref: 6-9). Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis (Ref: 10-16), the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nHigh-throughput pooled in vivo screens using barcoded human cancer cell lines (Ref: 2) have revealed organ-specific metastasis patterns across tumour types, including PDAC, which frequently spreads to the liver and lungs. Using data from these screens (https://depmap.org/metmap/), we calculated fractional seeding ratios for 25 PDAC cell lines across 5 metastatic sites (liver, lung, kidney, brain and bone) (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c). Cluster 1 exhibited a mean liver metastatic potential of 70.6% and penetrance of 37.9%, whereas cluster 2 showed low liver tropism (3.5% potential, 9.8% penetrance) and higher lung affinity (31.2% potential, 51.3% penetrance) (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). To validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections. Intrasplenic injection of KP4 or Panc-1 led to liver tumours within four weeks, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II did not grow in the liver (Fig. 1d\u2013g). Conversely, tail vein injection resulted in lung tumours from HPAC and HPAF-II, but not from KP4 or Panc-1 (Fig. 1h\u2013k). Introduction of each cell line into the blood stream via intracardiac injection further confirmed these patterns: KP4 and Panc-1 preferentially colonized the liver, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II favoured the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Notably, all four cell lines share identical KRAS, CDKN2A and TP53 mutations, suggesting that somatic drivers do not explain organ-specific colonization. Together, these results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1-Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2-Lung). To determine whether differential colonization by C1-Liver and C2-Lung cells reflects differences in seeding or outgrowth, we co-injected equal numbers of mCherry-labelled KP4 (KP4-R, C1-Liver) and eGFP-labelled HPAC (HPAC-G, C2-Lung) cells via intrasplenic (liver) or tail vein (lung) routes (Fig. 1l). After 14 days\u2014a time frame sufficient for seeding but not overgrowth\u2014we analysed organs by flow cytometry and 3D light-sheet microscopy. Flow cytometry-based analysis showed enrichment for KP4-R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC-G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Light-sheet microscopy showed large KP4-R foci and very few HPAC-G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig. 1m,n and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Differential organ preference of PDAC cells. a, Workflow for deriving metastatic potential and penetrance of PDAC cell lines using the MetMap500 database. b, Petal plots depicting metastatic potential (length) and penetrance (colour) for the indicated cell lines.

For instance, basal PDAC displays features of poor differentiation, whereas classical PDAC is well-differentiated. We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2). Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well-differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6\u2014a transcription factor associated with the classical subtype (Ref: 22) (Extended Data Fig. 1h\u2013k). By contrast, liver lesions (35 out of 45) were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining (Extended Data Fig. 1h\u2013m and Supplementary Table 3), consistent with basal-like features (Ref: 20-24). To test whether subtype determines organ avidity, we utilized CRISPR-mediated gene silencing to knock out GATA6 in HPAC cells. Although this shifted transcriptional profiles from classical to basal (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), GATA6 loss did not affect growth or metastatic colonization (Extended Data Fig. 2c\u2013f). Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\n\nTo identify molecular features that distinguish liver-avid versus lung-avid PDAC lines, we performed gene expression correlation analysis (https://depmap.org/) and identified PCSK9 to be the top enriched transcript in GATA6-positive C2-Lung lines (Fig. 2a). High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c). C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). By contrast, C1-Liver lines had little or no PCSK9 and expressed high total and cell surface LDLR levels (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, mouse PDAC cell lines derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC (referred to as KPC (Ref: 25)), showed a similar inverse relationship between PCSK9 and LDLR (Extended Data Fig. 3f), with PCSK9-low lines colonizing the liver and PCSK9-high lines favouring the lung (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). To evaluate expression of PCSK9 and LDLR in primary and metastatic PDAC, we performed immunohistochemical staining of primary specimens from patients with PDAC. Poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases had low expression of PCSK9 and high expression of LDLR, whereas well-differentiated tumours and lung metastases had high PCSK9 expression and low LDLR expression (Fig. 2d\u2013g and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We next utilized a matched cohort of primary PDAC from patients who subsequently developed liver (liver cohort) or lung (lung cohort) only metastases (Ref: 26) (Supplementary Table 6). PDAC tumours from the liver cohort exhibited low PCSK9 and high LDLR staining within the ductal epithelia, whereas tumours from the lung cohort showed high PCSK9 and low LDLR staining (Fig. 2h,i). Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary PDAC and the matched liver metastases (Ref: 27) further confirmed PCSK9 enrichment in classical subtype clusters and its reduction in liver metastases compared with matched primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3i\u2013m). Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\n\n> Fig. 2 | PCSK9 levels correlate with metastatic organ preference. a, Top ranked gene expression correlation with GATA6 showing PCSK9 as the top correlated gene along with classical PDAC subtype genes. b, Immunoblot of the indicated proteins in C1-Liver and C2-Lung cell lines. c, Schematic depicting LDL uptake via LDL receptor (LDLR) and the function of PCSK9 in regulation of LDLR trafficking to the lysosome.

C1-Liver and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed high uptake of fluorescently labelled Dil\u2013LDL as measured by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) and immunofluorescence staining of lysosomal localized Dil\u2013LDL (Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013f), relative to C2-Lung PCSK9-high cells, which had minimal uptake. Moreover, filipin staining, which visualizes cellular cholesterol depots, revealed high levels of lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver lines consistent with high cholesterol uptake rates, whereas C2-Lung lines predominantly displayed plasma membrane cholesterol and minimal lysosomal staining (Extended Data Fig. 4g\u2013i). Low PCSK9, high LDL uptake and lysosomal cholesterol was also evident in cells isolated from KPC-derived liver metastases, relative to the matched isogenic primary PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 4j\u2013n). LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). In response, C1-Liver lines upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes via SCAP-SREBP feedback (Ref: 28,29) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c); while C2-Lung lines did not (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Similar to lipoprotein depletion, CRISPR-mediated knockout of LDLR also led to a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 5g), was selectively detrimental to C1-Liver lines relative to C2-Lung lines (Extended Data Fig. 5h\u2013j) and impaired growth of KP4 cells in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l).\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\n\nConsistent with their low uptake of LDL-cholesterol, PCSK9-high C2-Lung lines showed increased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes, including the master transcriptional regulator SREBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013d), a pattern that was also observed in patient lung metastases compared with liver lesions (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Liver metastases also displayed lower expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to the primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Moreover, DepMap data revealed that high PCSK9 expression correlated with dependency on late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis genes in PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Accordingly, knockout of FDFT1 and SQLE impaired growth of C2-Lung lines but not C1-Liver lines, which rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013k). All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013k). This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30). Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL uptake.\n\n> Fig. 3 | Differential cholesterol metabolism directs metastatic organ preference.a, Schematic depicting experiments utilizing LPDS. b, Percentage confluency of C1-Liver lines (red bars) and C2-lung lines (blue bars) following culture in LPDS for 96 h.

For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\n\nTo test whether PCSK9 levels directly influence organ-specific growth, we first engineered the liver-avid KP4 line to express wild-type PCSK9, a gain-of-function mutant (D374Y) or a loss-of-function variant (R46L) (Ref: 31,32) (Fig. 3e). Wild-type PCSK9 and PCSK9(D374Y) caused a decrease in LDLR levels (Fig. 3e), decreased LDL uptake (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) and a shift towards de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, as evidenced by increased expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes (Fig. 3e). When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver over a period of four to five weeks, whereas cells expressing wild-type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver over the same time frame (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, whereas parental KP4 cells did not grow in the lungs, PCSK9(D374Y)-expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs (Fig. 3f,h). We next tested whether knockout of PCSK9 or overexpression of LDLR in a C2-Lung line, HPAC, was sufficient to enable growth within the liver. CRISPR-mediated knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake and reduced cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d) without affecting in vitro growth (Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, upon tail vein injection, PCSK9-knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells treated with non-targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Fig. 3j\u2013l). Similarly, overexpression of LDLR in HPAC cells phenocopied PCSK9 suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7f\u2013i) and led to increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). Finally, CRISPR-mediated Pcsk9 knockout in mouse PDAC cells transplanted into syngeneic hosts also lead to decreased growth in the lungs and increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7l\u2013s), with no effect on primary pancreatic tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 7t,u). These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2013LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively. Our findings show that baseline levels of PCSK9 predict secondary organ preference, especially in patients with liver-only or lung-only metastases (see Fig. 2h). However, PCSK9-high and PCSK9-low cells can coexist within the same primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Since PDAC cells can reach both the liver and lungs regardless of PCSK9 status (see Fig. 1l\u2013n), we tested whether PCSK9 expression still predicts colonization in heterogenous tumours. Using mouse MT23 cells (shown in Extended Data Fig. 4j), which form primary tumours with variable PCSK9 expression, we found that liver metastases uniformly expressed low PCSK9, whereas lung metastases showed high expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). These results confirm that PCSK9 status reliably predicts organ-specific colonization and tumour burden in the liver or the lungs.\n\n### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\n\nWe next sought to determine the fate of the LDL-cholesterol actively taken up by C1-Liver cells, and its specific role in promoting survival and colonization of the liver. Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1 (refs. 33,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling. Consistent with this model, DepMap reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data confirmed a positive correlation between liver colonization potential and mTOR activity (Fig. 4c), and patient liver metastases had higher phosphorylated S6 than lung lesions (Fig. 4d). Conversely, high PCSK9 mRNA levels correlated with lower mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig. 9d), supporting a model in which low PCSK9 promotes liver growth via LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake and mTORC1 activation. Following its export from the lysosome, cholesterol can be partly converted to oxysterols by the action of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. In turn, release of oxysterols relieves potential cholesterol overload in the producing cells and can exert modulatory functions on the surrounding tissue, including effects that promote tumour growth and metastasis (Ref: 35). We therefore assessed whether C1-Liver cells express enzymes required for oxysterol production. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT\u2013qPCR) revealed that the mRNA level of CYP46A1, which encodes a cholesterol hydroxylase that synthesizes 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), was upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PDAC dataset (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Other cholesterol hydroxylases showed no correlation with PCSK9 status (Extended Data Fig. 9g), suggesting a specific role for CYP46A1 in C1-Liver cells. In support of this idea, high CYP46A1 expression was correlated with increased liver invasion potential in PDAC cells (Fig. 4f). Studies in the brain have shown that 24-HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37). Given that hepatocytes are the primary source of LDL-cholesterol synthesis in the liver, we tested whether an analogous tumour\u2013hepatocyte circuit may also exist during colonization of the liver. To do so, we measured activation of LXR target genes in primary mouse hepatocytes following incubation for 24 h with conditioned medium isolated from KP4 (C1-Liver) or HPAC (C2-Lung) cells (Fig. 4g). Only conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes (ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRA, PLTP, SREBF1 and APOE) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Similarly, treatment with KP4-conditioned medium but not HPAC-conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig. 9h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4-conditioned medium in hepatocytes. The ability of KP4-conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1 (Extended Data Fig. 9i\u2013k). Accordingly, addition of exogenous 24-HC was able to rescue LXR target gene expression in hepatocytes treated with medium conditioned by CYP46A1-knockout KP4 cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j). To assess whether LXR activation occurs in hepatocytes in vivo, tumour-adjacent and non-adjacent sections from liver metastases were stained for the LXR transcriptional target ABCA1 (Fig. 4i), a cholesterol exporter belonging to the ABC family of transporters. Tumour-adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non-adjacent hepatocytes (Fig. 4j,k), suggesting that hepatocytes in proximity to tumour cells activate LXR target gene expression to a higher degree than non-adjacent hepatocytes. These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth. Consistent with this idea, CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in vitro proliferation, whereas lung growth remained low and unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 9l\u2013o). Thus, CYP46A1-mediated oxysterol signalling promotes liver-specific growth. Overall, increased LDL uptake in C1-Liver cells supports mTORC1-mediated growth and production of oxysterols that enhance the tumour-supportive niche.\n\n> Fig. 4 | Liver-avid cells utilize cholesterol to activate mTORC1 and condition the microenvironment. a, Representative immunofluorescence images (left) and quantification (right) of lysosomal cholesterol in KP4 and HPAC cells grown in media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) or LPDS for 72 h.

Recent studies have shown that resistance to ferroptosis\u2014an iron-dependent form of cell death involving phospholipid peroxidation (Ref: 38)\u2014is mediated by several late-step cholesterol synthesis intermediates including squalene (Ref: 39) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) (Ref: 40-42). The 5,7-diene B ring structure of 7-DHC functions as a radical-trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref: 40-42), and sterols with similar structural features, such as 7-dehydrodesmosterol (7-DHD), also have anti-ferroptotic capabilities (Fig. 5a). High expression of sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D), 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) and DHCR24 expression, along with several other distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes, positively correlated with PCSK9-high status in samples from patients with PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and in C2-Lung lines (see Extended Data Fig. 6b). Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7-DHC and 7-DHD in HPAC (C2-Lung) versus KP4 (C1-Liver) cells (Fig. 5b,c) and expression of active PCSK9 (D374Y) in KP4 cells was sufficient to increase the levels of these sterols (Fig. 5d,e). To test whether cholesterol biosynthesis influences ferroptosis sensitivity, we treated C1-Liver and C2-Lung PDAC lines with the GPX4 inhibitors RSL3 and ML210. C2-Lung lines were collectively more resistant, showing higher mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values relative to C1-Liver lines (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Similarly, HPAC cells were relatively resistant to RSL3 treatment (Fig. 5g,h). Accordingly, HPAC cells resisted RSL3-induced death, as measured by SYTOX Green, whereas KP4 cells were highly sensitive\u2014an effect that was reversed by adding exogenous 7-DHC or 7-DHD but not desmosterol (Fig. 5g, j). Addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid enhanced RSL3-induced cell death in both KP4 and HPAC cells, but to a greater extent in KP4 cells (Fig. 5g\u2013i). These findings suggest that intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2-Lung cells from oxidative stress. Accordingly, knockout of PCSK9, or blocking the synthesis of 7-DHC and 7-DHD following knockout of SC5D, sensitized HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10c\u2013e) and reduced lung colonization (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). In KP4 cells, expression of dominant active PCSK9(D374Y), which causes a shift towards cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 3e), reduced sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Knockout of SC5D had no effect, consistent with the reduced reliance on sterol biosynthesis in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). Notably, pre-treatment of liver-avid KPC1 cells with 7-DHC or 7-DHD for 24 h in vitro was sufficient to enhance lung colonization following tail vein injection (Fig. 5j,k). Consistent with these findings, unbiased analysis of CRISPR dependency data across 1,005 cancer cell lines showed that PCSK9-low status is strongly associated with sensitivity to GPX4 loss and several additional ferroptosis-protective genes (Fig. 5l) as well as GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10k). Together, these findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death.\n\n> Fig. 5 | Lung-avid PDAC cells produce sterol intermediates with anti-ferroptotic properties. a, Schematic showing distal cholesterol biosynthesis steps that generate 7-DHC and 7-DHD.

The text mentions the scRNA-seq analysis, the 21 clusters, and the changes in gene expression (Fig. 1a-d). The Premise is the data from their experiments.\n\nThe Connecting Principle here is not explicitly stated. They might be relying on existing knowledge that changes in stromal cell gene expression can affect the tumor microenvironment, but it's not cited. So the Connecting Principle is (missing).\n\nNext subsection: \"Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\". The Interpretation here is the conclusion that they generated a map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors essential for disease progression. The Premise is their analysis of gene expression and CRISPR screen data, leading to the identification of 38 genes and subsequent mapping. The Connecting Principle is the use of NicheNet and literature, which is a methodological bridge but not a biological principle. So the Connecting Principle is (missing) here as well.\n\nMoving to \"TME signals support leukaemogenesis\". The Interpretation is the conclusion that CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs and differentiating osteolineage cells. The Premise includes the scRNA-seq analysis showing CDO1 expression in MSCs and the increase during AML progression. The Connecting Principle is the established knowledge that CDO1 is involved in taurine biosynthesis, but since it's not explicitly cited, it's (missing).\n\nIn the \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\" subsection, the Interpretation is that TAUT is critical for myeloid leukemia initiation and propagation. The Premise is the experiments showing reduced LSC growth and survival with TAUT loss. The Connecting Principle is the role of taurine in metabolism, which is implicit but not stated, so (missing).\n\nFor \"TAUT is essential for human AML growth\", the Interpretation is that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be valuable across AML subtypes. The Premise is the data on SLC6A6 expression in resistant cells and the effect of inhibitors. The Connecting Principle is the known role of TAUT in taurine transport, which is implicit.\n\nLastly, \"Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\" has the Interpretation that the taurine-TAUT axis regulates glycolysis via mTOR. The Premise is the metabolomic and proteomic data showing glycolysis downregulation. The Connecting Principle is the established role of mTOR in glycolysis, which is mentioned with a reference, so that's the Connecting Principle.\n\nI need to make sure each component is correctly identified as per the definitions. For each triplet, check if the Premise is a specific finding from the study, the Connecting Principle is an established fact, and the Interpretation is the conclusion drawn. If any component is missing or implicit, mark it as such. Then structure the JSON accordingly, grouping by subsection and ensuring the order of interpretation, premise, and connecting principle is followed.\n", "response": "\n\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Our flow-cytometry-based analyses of an independent cohort of leukaemic mice validated these changes, showing increases in MSCs, osteolineage and arteriolar endothelial cells, with a concomitant decline in sinusoidal endothelial populations (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1e).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"This led to the exclusion of receptors with no known ligands (MR1, TMCO3 and TSPAN15) as well as those of which the ligands were not significantly enriched in any TME population (LGALS3BP, CD96, CD274 and CD3D).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig. 2a).\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"TME signals support leukaemogenesis\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Our analysis of publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients (Ref: 23) showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig. 4j).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Our experiments showed that mouse LSCs co-cultured with osteolineage cells lacking Cdo1 expression were significantly less viable (about 2-fold lower than the controls) and formed fewer colonies (3.4-fold less than controls), which could be rescued by supplementing cultures with taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5e\u2013g).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"Thus, taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3m,n).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"TAUT is essential for human AML growth\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"SLC6A6 expression is enriched in leukaemia stem/progenitors as compared to more mature blasts (Extended Data Fig. 8a).\",\n        \"connecting_principle\": \"(missing)\",\n        \"interpretation\": \"These data collectively indicate that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n      {\n        \"premise_finding\": \"Our RNA-seq analysis identified 932 downregulated and 1,158 upregulated genes in the absence of TAUT (Padj < 0.05).

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified (Ref: 1\u20135), concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies (Ref: 6) to identify LSC\u2013niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine\u2013taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours (Ref: 1\u20135,7\u201310). While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours (Ref: 11,12), concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest. Aggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blast-crisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche (Ref: 13\u201315), their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in vivo leukaemia progression (Ref: 6). This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT\u2013KITL and CD47\u2013thrombospondin 1 (Ref: 16), as well as multiple new signalling axes. Of these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6, was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy (Ref: 17) or support anti-cancer immunity (Ref: 18), a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n\nTo define temporal changes in non-immune bone marrow microenvironment populations during myeloid leukaemia progression, we used bcCML LSCs, which can grow in unirradiated mouse recipients (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Bone marrow stromal populations (leukaemia\u207bCD45\u207bTER119\u207b) were isolated from leukaemic cohorts at distinct stages of disease progression and analysed using scRNA-seq (Fig. 1a). Gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo-associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d). Our flow-cytometry-based analyses of an independent cohort of leukaemic mice validated these changes, showing increases in MSCs, osteolineage and arteriolar endothelial cells, with a concomitant decline in sinusoidal endothelial populations (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Clustering analyses of genes expressed in major lineages identified gene sets with similar changes in expression (Extended Data Fig. 1f), suggesting that these may represent altered stromal cell fate. Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Temporal scRNA-seq analysis of myeloid leukaemia bone marrow microenvironment. a, The experimental strategy used to determine the impact of bcCML progression on bone-marrow microenvironment remodelling. b, A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of 15,695 non-haematopoietic cells from bone and bone marrow shows 21 distinct bone marrow stromal cell clusters (n = 3 (naive), n = 6 (initiation), n = 7 (expansion) and n = 9 (end) mice).

To identify LSC receptors associated with disease progression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of human AML and bcCML CD34\u207a cells, and healthy donor bone marrow CD34\u207a haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; Extended Data Fig. 2b). We noted significant (adjusted P (Padj) < 0.05) upregulation of 1,569 genes in bcCML, 2,842 genes in AML and 2,331 genes in both bcCML and AML compared with normal HSPCs. To identify signals that are functionally relevant for disease progression, we found cell surface genes (Ref: 19) that drop out by twofold or more in our genome-wide in vivo leukaemia CRISPR screen (Ref: 6). This identified 13 cell surface signals common to both bcCML and AML, 18 unique to AML and 7 unique to bcCML. Of these 38 genes, 16 were misannotated as cell surface in the reference dataset (Ref: 19) and were removed from further analysis (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). We used NicheNet and the published literature to identify ligands for these receptors, especially those that were significantly upregulated in our TME scRNA-seq data and in the human AML immune microenvironment (Ref: 20) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). This led to the exclusion of receptors with no known ligands (MR1, TMCO3 and TSPAN15) as well as those of which the ligands were not significantly enriched in any TME population (LGALS3BP, CD96, CD274 and CD3D). We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig. 2a). We next determined whether disease progression could alter the expression of LSC-specific TME ligands, and identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr, Cdo1, Apoe and Agt (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013d). Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\n\n### Subsection: TME signals support leukaemogenesis\n\nMultiple TME\u2013LSC signalling axes identified in our interactome may have a functional role in leukaemia progression. However, we were interested in genes associated with unfavourable outcomes in human patients with AML. Of the 22 genes upregulated in human LSCs, only low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and SLC6A6 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML (Fig. 2a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). We therefore tested the functional requirement of TME-derived ligands of LDLR and SLC6A6 on LSC growth. One of the primary LDLR ligands, apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Ref: 21), was highly expressed in MSCs (Extended Data Fig. 3d). To test the role of APOE from MSCs on LSC function, we co-cultured bcCML LSCs with MSCs transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apoe or LacZ (control; Extended Data Fig. 4c). Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls; Extended Data Fig. 4d\u2013f). SLC6A6 encodes TAUT, which has high affinity for the non-essential amino acid taurine, and low affinity for \u03b2-alanine (taurine Km = 4.5 \u03bcM versus \u03b2-alanine Km = 56 \u03bcM) (Ref: 22). Our experiments indicate that Slc6a6 expression can be directly induced by oncogenes (Extended Data Fig. 4g). While the leukaemia TME did not express enzymes required for \u03b2-alanine synthesis (Gadl1 and Cndp1), those needed for taurine biosynthesis were expressed in osteo-associated cells (Cdo1 and Csad; Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). Our analysis of publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients (Ref: 23) showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig. 4j). To test whether CDO1 is expressed in the human leukaemia TME, we performed an scRNA-seq analysis of CD45\u207b stromal cells from three myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML bone marrow aspirates. Our analysis of the limited numbers of stromal cells in these samples indicate that CDO1 expression is restricted to the MSC/osteolineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 4k,l), as we see in mouse samples. Notably, we found a marked increase in CDO1 protein expression in nearly all matched biopsies of patients who progressed from MDS to secondary AML, and those who relapsed after AML diagnosis (Fig. 2d\u2013g and Extended Data Fig. 4m\u2013p). While CDO1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated human AML MSCs, its expression increased during in vitro mouse and human AML MSC osteogenic differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013c). Thus, CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow. Importantly, taurine levels in extracellular medium increased during MSC differentiation, indicating that elevated CDO1 expression is correlated with taurine production (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To determine a functional role of taurine from osteolineage cells, we tested the impact of inhibiting taurine biosynthesis in mouse and human leukaemia bone-marrow-derived MSCs on co-cultured leukaemia cells. Our experiments showed that mouse LSCs co-cultured with osteolineage cells lacking Cdo1 expression were significantly less viable (about 2-fold lower than the controls) and formed fewer colonies (3.4-fold less than controls), which could be rescued by supplementing cultures with taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5e\u2013g). Similarly, inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5h), indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival. Consistent with a functional role of taurine from the TME in leukaemia progression, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig. 2j). In mice, the majority of taurine is synthesized in the liver from cysteine (Ref: 24). To determine whether taurine produced locally in the bone marrow niche is essential for leukaemia growth, we generated a new Cdo1fl/fl mouse model and crossed it to MSC/osteolineage-specific Prrx1-cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 5i\u2013k). We used these as recipients for LSCs and monitored survival, and the impact on bone marrow microenvironment populations. Our experiments showed that Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre\u207a mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls, indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression, at least in part (Fig. 2k). We did not find any significant changes in the composition of TME in Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre\u207a leukaemic mice as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 5l\u2013n), suggesting that leukaemia-driven remodelling of the bone marrow niche does not depend on taurine produced by osteolineage cells. We finally tested whether exogenous taurine supplements can promote leukaemia growth. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of mouse LSCs and patient-derived AML cells increased by 1.2- to 3.3-fold in the presence of taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5o\u2013q). Taurine supplements could significantly accelerate disease progression in immunocompetent mice (around threefold higher likelihood of death relative to the controls; Extended Data Fig. 5r), indicating that taurine can promote leukaemic progression. Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs. As SLC6A6 expression was significantly enriched in both human bcCML and AML LSCs as compared to the controls, we focused our studies on SLC6A6, as it may be broadly required for growth of aggressive leukaemias.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Bone marrow microenvironmental ligands for LSC-specific cell surface receptors. a, Circos plot showing leukaemia cell surface receptors and cognate stromal-cell-derived ligands. b, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of human patients with leukaemia with low (<11.14, n = 80) or high (\u226511.14, n = 81) SLC6A6 expression (TCGA-LAML; Xena Browser; log-rank test).

While Slc6a6-knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios, they can develop ageing-related defects in bone mass and retinal degeneration (Ref: 25\u201327). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche. TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig. 6b). TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability (Fig. 3e), as well as a marked increase in the survival of mice transplanted with Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs (40%) relative to control LSCs (0%) in secondary transplant assays (21.2-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3f). The 8.5-fold reduction in colony-forming ability of bcCML LSCs from secondary transplants suggests that these leukaemias remain dependent on TAUT expression and taurine uptake for their continued propagation (Fig. 3g,h). We noted no significant differences in bone marrow microenvironmental populations of mice bearing Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b leukaemias as compared to the controls, indicating that leukaemia-driven niche remodelling possibly reflects the extent of the tumour burden, and may be independent of taurine levels within leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013g). To determine whether TAUT is broadly required for de novo AML growth, we tested the impact of its loss on initiation of leukaemia driven by MLL-AF9/NRAS(G12V) and by AML-ETO9a/NRAS(G12V). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3i\u2013k). Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b KIT\u207a AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig. 3l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs. Consistent with a key role of TAUT expression in myeloid leukaemia initiation, TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3m,n). At the cellular level, TAUT loss led to a 2.4- to 3.6-fold reduction in primitive Lin\u207bCD150\u207bFLT3\u207aSCA1\u207a LSCs (Ref: 6) (Fig. 3o). Furthermore, TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin\u207a differentiated cells (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 6h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig. 3q). These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia. We next tested the impact of TAUT loss on normal haematopoiesis. Our analysis indicates that TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady-state (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013e). While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Although overall bone marrow chimerism 4 months after transplant was 2.4-fold lower in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b HSC recipients as compared to Slc6a6+/+ HSC recipients, these Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b HSCs were able to contribute to all haematopoietic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 7h\u2013k). Serial transplantation of Slc6a6+/+ and Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b bone marrow cells showed a similar loss in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b engraftment over time (Extended Data Fig. 7l\u2013q). These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC-enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self-renewal. However, therapeutic inhibition of CD98 showed minimal toxicity in AML phase I trials (Ref: 1) and BCL2 inhibitors are approved for AML therapy. It is therefore possible that non-genetic approaches using small-molecule inhibitors or gene silencing may identify a therapeutic window for TAUT targeting in human cells. We therefore tested the impact of TAUT inhibition on growth and proliferation of normal human HSPCs as well as patient-derived AML cells.\n\n> Fig. 3 | TAUT loss impairs myeloid leukaemia initiation and propagation in mouse models. a, Relative Slc6a6 mRNA expression in whole bone marrow cells from Slc6a6+/+ (+/+) and Slc6a6\u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) mice.

While SLC6A6 is broadly expressed in AML irrespective of karyotype or FAB subtype (TCGA; Extended Data Fig. 8b), increased expression correlates with venetoclax resistance (BEAT-AML; Fig. 4a). SLC6A6 expression is also enriched in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-low LSCs from human monocytic AMLs (subtype clinically associated with venetoclax resistance; CD45brightSSChighCD117\u207bCD11b\u207aCD68\u207a) compared with primitive AML (Fig. 4b; CD45medSSClowCD117\u207aCD11b\u207bCD68\u207b) (Ref: 32). We find increased SLC6A6 expression in leukaemia cells carrying RAS mutations as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with data correlating RAS mutations with venetoclax resistance (Ref: 33) (Fig. 4c). SLC6A6 is also highly expressed in relapsed AML originating from stem/progenitor like cells compared with more committed populations (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 8c). These data collectively indicate that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance. To determine whether small-molecule inhibitors of TAUT can effectively block leukaemia growth, we used two well-characterized structural analogues of taurine that inhibit uptake: 6-aminomethyl-3-methyl-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide hydrochloride (Ref: 35) (TAG) and guanidinoethyl sulphonate (Ref: 36) (GES; Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6+/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f\u2013h). Importantly, while TAG and GES impaired growth of primary human AML cells in colony assays by 1.8- to 20-fold, they did not impact normal human CD34\u207a HSPC colony growth (Fig. 4d,e). We next tested whether venetoclax can exacerbate the impact of TAUT loss and/or inhibition on LSC function. Our experiments showed that venetoclax reduced the viability of mouse Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs by 3.2-fold and lowered their colony formation by 13.2-fold as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). While TAG, GES or venetoclax alone could impair mouse LSC colony formation by 1.4- to 3.9-fold, their combination was synergistic and led to 2.3- to 7.2-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8k\u2013m). While primary human AML cells that were treated with GES, TAG or venetoclax alone formed 1.3- to 8.3-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls, combining the treatments substantially impaired colony formation by 2.4- to 150-fold. These data indicate that taurine inhibitors can synergize with venetoclax in blocking the growth of human AML cells (Fig. 4f\u2013h). As TAG and GES did not effectively block taurine uptake in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013j), we used shRNA-based approaches to determine the impact of inhibiting TAUT expression on human AML growth. Knocking down SLC6A6 expression using two independent shRNAs significantly impaired taurine uptake by 2.2 to 3.4-fold, as well as the colony-forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines by 2- to 12-fold (Extended Data Fig. 9k\u2013p). Our experiments showed that SLC6A6 knockdown in samples from patients with AML reduced their colony-forming ability by 2.33- to 9.12-fold as compared to the controls (Fig. 4i). By contrast, SLC6A6 knockdown did not impact colonies formed by normal human CD34\u207a HSPCs (Fig. 4j). Importantly, while SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2- to 40-fold in patient-derived xenograft models (Fig. 4k,l), it did not significantly impair engraftment of normal human CD34\u207a HSPCs in xenograft models (Fig. 4m). Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\n\n> Fig. 4 | TAUT inhibition impairs growth of patient-derived AML cells. a, SLC6A6 expression based on venetoclax (Ven) response (BEAT-AML). n = 193; dot plots show individual patients.

Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells, suggesting that taurine may regulate energy metabolism (Fig. 5a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Consistent with this, we noted a 1.3- to 1.8-fold reduction in basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs as compared to the controls (Fig. 5d,e and Extended Data Fig. 10b). To functionally test the role of glycolysis and TCA associated metabolites, we determined whether bypassing these could rescue Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b defects. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs could be significantly rescued by pyruvate, sodium acetate and lactate, but not glucagon (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10c\u2013e). These data suggest that glycolysis, and not gluconeogenesis, is the primary downstream effector of taurine in leukaemia cells. We next tested whether taurine contributed to any cellular metabolite by determining 13C-taurine incorporation in K562 leukaemia cells. Our untargeted metabolomic approach identified 13C label only in known taurine conjugates, N-acetyl taurine and glutaurine (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Membrane-permeable taurine fully rescued colonies formed by Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells (Fig. 5g), and N-acetyl-taurine partly rescued this defect (Extended Data Fig. 10h), perhaps by breakdown to taurine and acetate (Ref: 37). By contrast, glutaurine was unable to rescue the Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b colony formation (Extended Data Fig. 10i). These experiments indicate that taurine, and not a secondary metabolite, promotes leukaemia growth due to an indirect effect on glycolysis, possibly through downstream signalling. To identify signals downstream of taurine, we performed RNA-seq as well as phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses of primary mouse leukaemia cells (Fig. 5h). Our RNA-seq analysis identified 932 downregulated and 1,158 upregulated genes in the absence of TAUT (Padj < 0.05). The 1,158 upregulated genes included pathways associated with haematopoietic cell lineage and cell cycle regulation (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). The 932 downregulated genes primarily constituted pathways associated with glycolysis (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 11b\u2013d), consistent with reduced abundance of glycolysis associated metabolites in these cells (Fig. 5c). To determine effectors of glycolytic downregulation on TAUT loss, we performed gene set enrichment analysis. This identified profound downregulation of oncogenic MYC and mTOR pathways (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 11c). As mTOR signalling is known to regulate expression of glycolysis related genes (Ref: 38), we tested whether TAUT loss impairs mTOR activation. Western blot analysis showed that TAUT loss results in a 2.2- to 3-fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m and Extended Data Fig. 11e). Our global phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses also showed reduced expression of phosphorylated proteins associated with mTOR signalling, as well as 3.3-fold reduced BCL2 and 1.5-fold increased LC3A expression in the absence of TAUT (Extended Data Fig. 11f,g). Like TAUT loss, TAUT inhibition with TAG and GES downregulated glycolysis-related gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i) and impaired phosphorylation of mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Consistent with a direct impact of taurine on mTOR signalling, acute treatment in vitro and long-term taurine dosing in vivo could activate mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12c\u2013h). Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin impaired the growth of wild-type cells but did not impact Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells in vitro or in vivo (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 12i,k). By contrast, mTOR activation with MHY1485 (Ref: 39) rescued the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs to 60% of the control, and membrane-permeable taurine rescued mTOR activation (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 12j\u2013l). Collectively, these data indicate that mTOR signalling has a key role downstream of taurine in leukaemia cells. Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation. We hypothesized that taurine may activate mTOR by promoting its interaction with RAG GTPases. To test this, we determined the effect of expressing constitutively active RAGA(Q66L) or RHEB(Q64L) on the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 wild-type and null cells. Our experiments showed that, while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5p). Furthermore, mTOR phosphorylation in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells could be rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Extended Data Fig. 12m). Finally, we directly tested whether taurine could promote mTOR interactions with lysosomes in wild-type and Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b leukaemia cells expressing RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5q). Our immunofluorescence-based analysis showed that, at the baseline, Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells have 1.2-fold lower mTOR\u2013LAMP1 interaction, which could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L). Taurine supplements increased mTOR\u2013LAMP1 co-localization to levels seen in cells expressing RAGA(Q66L). However, this interaction could not be increased further by adding taurine to RAGA(Q66L)-expressing cells (Fig. 5r,s), consistent with our colony-forming assays (Extended Data Fig. 12n). Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2013TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG-mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\n\n> Fig. 5 | TAUT loss impairs glycolysis and mTOR signalling in myeloid leukaemia cells. a, The untargeted metabolomics strategy. b, Unbiased Enrichr analysis (MetaboAnalyst; Padj \u2264 0.05).

The connecting principle is that mitochondrial respiration is crucial for cell competition.\n\nIn \"Metformin increases methylation capacity\", they found that metformin increases SAM/SAH ratio. The connecting principle is that the methionine cycle generates SAM. The interpretation is that metformin enhances methylation potential.\n\nFor \"Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\", the premise is that metformin reverses DNA and histone methylation. The connecting principle is that DNMT3A mutations cause hypomethylation. The interpretation is that metformin's effect on methylation index reverses the epigenetic changes.\n\nIn \"Metformin suppresses human mutant HSPCs\", the premise is that metformin reduces competitive advantage in human cells. The connecting principle is similar to the mouse model. The interpretation is that metformin works in humans too.\n\nI need to make sure each triplet is correctly identified with the right components.

Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses (Ref: 1-4). Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot (Ref: 1-3,5-7). Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration (Ref: 8), reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers (Ref: 1-3,5,6). DNMT3A encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) (Ref: 7,9). Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations (Ref: 10,11). Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention. The mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous (Ref: 12,13). DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner (Ref: 13,14). Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts (Ref: 13,15). The effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs (Ref: 16), thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between Dnmt3aR878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCS\n\nAnalysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from primary AML samples revealed an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in DNMT3A R882-mutated patient samples, but not in non-R882DNMT3A-mutated samples, compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To validate this finding in the context of clonal haematopoiesis, we analysed a previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of CD34+-enriched HSPCs from individuals with clonal haematopoiesis (Ref: 17). Pseudobulk differential expression analysis also showed an increase in OXPHOS gene expression in DNMT3A R882-mutated cells relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function between Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ mouse HSPCs. We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells, which are enriched for HSPCs, possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, as determined by extracellular flux analysis (Fig. 1a). These differences were also observed in unfractionated whole bone marrow (WBM) cells, albeit by a smaller magnitude (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c). Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\n\n> Fig.1|Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs are dependent on increased mitochondrial respiration. a, Basal (left) and maximal (middle) OCRs in LK HSPCs.

To test this, we first established an in vitro competition assay in which CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells were mixed at a ratio of approximately 2:3 and cultured in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium for around 10 days, followed by determination of the proportions of CD45.2* and CD45.1+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a). A parallel competition assay between CD45.2+ Dnmt3a+/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells mixed at the same starting ratio served as a control. After the culture period, the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was consistently 20% to 30% higher than that of CD45.2+ Dnmt3a+/+ cells in the first passage and 40% to 50% higher in the second passage (Extended Data Fig. 1e), demonstrating the competitive advantage of the mutant cells. Using this assay, we studied the effect of genetic knockdown of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunits on the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by transducing the mixed CD45.2+ mutant-CD45.1+ wild-type population with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Ndufv1 and Cox15 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), which encode critical subunits in complex I and complex IV of the ETC, respectively. Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts. To explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin-a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)-on Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs. Consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (Ref: 18) (50 \u00b5M) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f). This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, a metformin-resistant yeast analogue of complex I (Ref: 19,20), thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition (Fig. 1g). Metformin treatment also selectively reduced the clonogenic potential of Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCS over Dnmt3a+/+ LK HSPCs in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To determine whether the effect of metformin was relevant in vivo and over a longer treatment period, we conducted a competitive repopulation experiment by mixing CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ WBM cells with CD45.1+ Dnmt3a++ WBM cells at a 2:3 ratio and transplanting the mixed cells into lethally irradiated recipients (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Five weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin in their drinking water at 5 mg ml\u00af\u00b9, a concentration that has previously been shown to result in blood concentrations similar to those achievable in humans (Ref: 21). Peripheral blood chimerism analysis showed a stable ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in mice that received CD45.2 Dnmt3a+/+ control cells, and the ratio was not affected by metformin treatment (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1b). By contrast, the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells steadily increased over a 7-month period in mice that received CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells, reflecting their competitive advantage over CD45.1+ wild-type cells (Fig. 1h). Notably, metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h). This effect was observed in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments (Extended Data Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n### Subsection: Metformin suppresses Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS\n\nMetformin suppressed the long-term competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ donor cells in vivo (Fig. 1h), reflective of an effect at the HSC level. To provide independent evidence for an effect at the HSC level and gain insights into the mechanism of action of metformin, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the untreated and metformin-treated recipients at the end of the 7-month treatment period (Fig. 1h). The cells were collected from the mice transplanted with CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ competitor cells and stained with antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates specific for CD45.2 or CD45.1 to identify their donor origin. A total of 22,407 cells from untreated control mice (n = 2) were sequenced, 84.6% of which were CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 2a). For comparison, a total of 23,818 cells from metformin-treated mice (n = 2) were sequenced, and the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was significantly less at 56.5% (P<0.0001by chi-square test) (Fig. 2a). To determine which HSPC subsets were affected, we annotated each cell on the basis of their correlation with reference mouse HSPC gene sets (Ref: 22) and identified 11 different haematopoietic subsets (Fig. 2a). Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig. 2b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow samples collected from mice after 4 months of treatment also showed a reduction in the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in immunophenotypically defined (Lin KIT+SCA-1+ CD150*CD48\u00af) HSCs and progenitor subsets (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). To corroborate these findings, we transplanted Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ donor WBM cells from sex-matched littermates in a non-competitive manner into lethally irradiated recipients. Five weeks after transplantation, the recipients were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). In untreated mice, the number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and the proportion of HSCs in the Lin SCA-1+KIT+ (LSK) fraction were higher in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients compared with Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d,e). The expansion of mutant HSCs was associated with a trend towards a higher proportion of HSCs in active cycling based on Ki-67 staining (Fig. 2f). Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d-f). Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. a, Top, dimensionality reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) on all sequenced cells (n = 46,225 cells).

This unexpected result suggested that metformin could influence mitochondrial respiration not only through a direct inhibition of complex I but also through downregulation of OXPHOS-related genes. To further investigate its mechanism of action, we first studied the effect of in vivo metformin treatment on mitochondrial function of HSPCs. We performed extracellular flux analysis on freshly isolated LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Metformin treatment reduced the basal and maximal OCRs as well as the Am of Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells to levels similar to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). To uncover the effect of metformin on specific metabolic pathways, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the untreated and treated LK cells of both Dnmt3a genotypes. This analysis, which focused on metabolites that are central to energy and redox metabolism, detected 101 named metabolites, of which 8 were significantly increased in metformin-treated mutant LK cells compared with untreated mutant cells (Supplementary Table 1). Of note, 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites (L-cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig. 3a,b). Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels and the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the intracellular concentrations of SAM and SAH, which were below the detection threshold of the bulk metabolomic analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, the methylation index was higher in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig. 3c), indicative of an increase in their cellular methylation potential. The effect of metformin on methylation index was observed only in Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs and not in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Fig. 3c). To determine whether the metformin-induced changes in methylation index could be due to alterations in the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK-enriched cells that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). GSEA of the RNA-seq dataset showed that metformin treatment decreased the expression of genes associated with stemness and OXPHOS (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f), consistent with our earlier results. Notably, it also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in 1C metabolism in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells (Fig. 3d). To confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles (Shmt2, Mthfd2l, Shmt1, Mthfd1, Mthfr, Ahcy, Cbs and Bhmt) and found that metformin treatment increased their expression in Dnmt3aR878H/+LK cells (Fig. 3e). Although metformin also up-regulated expression of these genes in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, the magnitude of change was much smaller (Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism. On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of exogenous SAM and SAH on the competitive advantage of mutant LK cells using our in vitro assay (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The suppressive effect of SAM on Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs was maintained after downregulation of Dnmt3b expression (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c), suggesting that this effect was independent of DNMT3B activity. Increasing the concentration of folic acid in the culture medium, which augments the availability of 1C units for SAM synthesis, also reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Conversely, exogenous SAH, which lowers the methylation index, counteracted the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To confirm these findings, we inhibited SHMT2 and MAT2A as alternative approaches to lowering the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio. SHMT2 generates a 1C unit (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) that is necessary for SAM synthesis through the folate and methionine cycles, and MAT2A directly catalyses the synthesis of SAM from methionine (Fig. 3a). In line with our hypothesis, pharmacologic inhibition of SHMT with SHIN-1 (Ref: 23) or MAT2A with AG-270 (Ref: 24) rescued the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant HSPCS (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). The addition of exogenous SAM mitigated the rescue effect of SHIN-1 (Extended Data Fig. 5g), indicating that SHIN-1 acts by reducing SAM production. Genetic knockdown of Shmt2 expression also rendered Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs resistant to the suppressive effect of metformin (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\n\n> Fig. 3 | Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by enhancing their methylation potential. a, Schematic of the metabolic pathways involved in 1C metabolism.

In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent (Ref: 13). We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that elimination of residual DNMT3A activity by inactivating the remaining wild-type Dnmt3a allele in mutant cells should render them resistant to the effect of metformin. To test this prediction, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells. The knockout efficiency was approximately 98%, indicative of biallelic inactivation in both cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Using our in vitro competition assay, we found that Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs, regardless of their initial Dnmt3a genotype (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Another prediction is that metformin treatment should increase the level of methylation at CpG sites that are differentially hypomethylated in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells. To test this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis of LK-enriched bone marrow cells from recipient mice that received Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ WBM cells from sex-matched littermate donors and were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The RRBS technique, which enriches for CpG-rich regions, was chosen because DNMT3A preferentially catalyses DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a+/+ (n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports (Ref: 13,17), the majority of the DMRs (n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples (Fig. 4a). In the comparison between metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 3) and untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) samples, we identified 3,285 DMRs, 1,923 (58.5%) of which were hypermethylated in the treated samples (Fig. 4a). We found 870 overlapping DMRs at the intersection between these two sets (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similar findings were observed in the subsets of DMRs associated with CpG islands and gene promoter regions (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To explore the potential effect of these changes in DNA methylation on gene expression, we conducted GSEA on genes ranked by differential promoter methylation and mRNA expression from our bulk RNA-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells, compared with Dnmt3a+/+ cells, exhibited decreased promoter methylation and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Re-analysis of a previously published combined transcriptome and methylome dataset of single progenitor cells from individuals with DNMT3A R882-mutated clonal haematopoiesis also revealed similar patterns in changes in the methylation and expression of genes associated with OXPHOS (Ref: 17) (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a+/+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Notably, metformin treatment reversed these aberrant changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In human clonal haematopoiesis, the DNMT3A R882 mutation has previously been reported to result in preferential DNA hypomethylation of targets of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Ref: 17), which catalyses the methylation of histone H3 K27 (H3K27). In addition, the Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Ref: 25), indicating its potential influence on another layer of epigenetic regulation. Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs. To test this, we performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This analysis revealed a reduction in H3K27me3 levels globally and in the regions surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples relative to the untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). Consistent with our hypothesis, metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). To confirm these findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured the amount of H3K27me3 by intracellular flow cytometry. Similar to the ChIP-seq results, we found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells had lower levels of H3K27me3 than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells and metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in mutant cells to levels resembling those of wild-type cells (Fig. 4e). Together, the above findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\n\n> Fig. 4 | Metformin reverses the aberrant epigenetic profiles in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs. a, Violin plots of the difference in beta values at all DMRs, CpG island-associated DMRs or promoter-associated DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples versus untreated Dnmt3a+/+ LK samples and between metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples versus untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples. n = 3 biologically independent samples for untreated Dnmt3a+/+ and metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+. n = 4 biologically independent samples for metformin-treated Dnmt3a+/+ and untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples.

Since DNMT3A R882-mutated cells retain about 20% of wild-type DNMT3A activity (Ref: 13), knockdown of DNMT3A expression should phenocopy the effects of DNMT3A R882 mutations. Using this approach and an in vitro competition assay with human cytokines (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 1c), we found that DNMT3A-knockdown (DNMT3A-KD) HSPCs displayed a competitive advantage over control HSPCs expressing a non-targeting shRNA (shNT) (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Consistent with our mouse studies, metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A-KD HSPCs (Fig. 5b). The effects of DNMT3A knockdown and metformin treatment were observed in both the CD34+ and CD34-cell fractions following ex vivo culture (Extended Data Fig. 8c). The suppressive effect of metformin was mitigated by the co-expression of NDI1 (Fig. 5b), indicating that the effect was mediated through inhibition of complex I. DNMT3A-KD HSPCs exhibited higher basal OCRs compared with control HSPCs, a difference that was eliminated by metformin treatment (Fig. 5c). Similar to mouse Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs, the levels of 5mCand H3K27me3 were lower in DNMT3A-KD cells than in control cells (Fig. 5d,e). Metformin treatment augmented the methylation index (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 8d) and increased 5mC and H3K27me3 in DNMT3A-KD cells (Fig. 5d,e), mirroring the mechanistic findings observed in mouse Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs. To further evaluate the effect of metformin on DNMT3A R882-mutated human HSPCs, we designed and optimized a prime editing strategy to introduce the R882H mutation into the DNMT3A gene in purified CD34+ HSPCs from cord blood samples. The Cas nickase (nCas)-based prime editing technique has been shown to cause less cytotoxic and genotoxic stress and edit with higher precision and efficiency in long-term repopulating HSPCs than conventional homology-directed repair-based CRISPR-Cas9 editing strategies (Ref: 26). Using the optimized prime editing strategy, we introduced the DNMT3AR882H mutation in five HSPC samples from independent donors. As a negative control, we introduced a T>G single nucleotide variant in exon 1 of the B2M gene that causes a premature stop codon (Ref: 26). After prime editing, the baseline (day 0) mean variant allele frequency (VAF) was 20% for DNMT3AR882H (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and 49.8% for the B2M single nucleotide variant (Fig. 5h). The edited cell pools were plated in methylcellulose medium to assess the relative competitive advantage of the DNMT3AR882H versus DNMT3A wild-type cells. After an additional 14 days in culture, the mean VAF of DNMT3A R882H increased to 42.4% in untreated cells, consistent with a relative expansion of the mutant population (Fig.5g). Metformin treatment suppressed the expansion of DNMT3A-mutated cells with a mean VAF of 26.2% (Fig. 5g). By contrast, the mean VAFs of B2M-edited cells did not significantly change after 14 days in culture with or without metformin treatment (Fig. 5h), indicating that the observed effects on DNMT3AR882H HSPCs were not an artefact of prime editing. Together, these results support the idea that metformin has the potential to suppress the competitive advantage of DNMT3A R882-mutated clones in human clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n> Fig. 5 | Metformin suppresses human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs. a, Schematic diagram of the in vitro competition assay of human CD34+-enriched HSPCs.
