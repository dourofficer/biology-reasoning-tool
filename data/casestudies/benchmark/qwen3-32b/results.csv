CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo,"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterized by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Of note, these cells showed upregulation of genes associated with NK cell inhibition, including ADGRG1, KIR2DL3 and KLRG1 (Fig. 1e).","Previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), but its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored.","Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced through the PKA–CREB axis,"Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b–d). Similarly, treatment with EGTA led to a consistent suppression of CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction (Fig. 2b–d).","The cAMP signalling pathway activates PKA, which phosphorylates CREB and CREM to regulate gene transcription (Ref: 30).",These data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA–CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3ζ or IL-15 stimulation.
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,Subsection: Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles,"We identified 5,430 DMRs [...] the majority of the DMRs (n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples [...] metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs [...] metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples [...] intracellular flow cytometry [...] found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells had lower levels of H3K27me3 than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells and metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in mutant cells.","The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref: 13,17). In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants [...] the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent (Ref: 13). PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio.","Together, the above findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs."

PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype,"Classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2). Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well-differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6, whereas liver lesions (35 out of 45) were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining (Extended Data Fig. 1h–m and Supplementary Table 3).","Prior transcriptional profiling studies have shown that PDAC can be stratified into two main transcriptional subtypes termed ‘basal’ and ‘classical’, which are linked to distinct molecular features and patient prognosis (Ref: 17-21).","These findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis."

CYP46A1 expression was upregulated in C1-Liver lines and correlated with liver invasion potential (Fig. 4e,f).","Lysosomal cholesterol activates mTORC1, a master nutrient sensor (refs. 33,34). 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol derived from CYP46A1 can modulate cholesterol efflux via LXR (Ref: 36,37).","These data indicate that PCSK9-low status and LDL-cholesterol uptake sustain mTORC1 activation and 24-HC production, which reprogram the liver microenvironment to support tumour growth."
