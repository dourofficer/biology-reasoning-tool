{"request_id": 0, "reasoning": "We need to parse the Results section and find the three-part logical argument structures. This is a fairly sizable excerpt with multiple subsections.

The connecting principle is prior knowledge, which may be cited, or general mechanism. If missing or implicit, mark accordingly.\n\nWe need to output JSON with an array of objects. Each object for a subsection, containing \"subsection\" name and \"triplets\" array. Each triplet contains \"premise_finding\", \"connecting_principle\", \"interpretation\".

So we must copy the exact phrase.\n\nLet\u2019s go through each subsection in order.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo\n\nWe must read this subsection text:\n\n> We have previously shown that CAR19-IL-15 NK cells derived from cord blood exert potent activity in vivo (Ref: 14). We also analysed their single-cell transcriptional signatures after adoptive transfer in a non-curative mouse model of lymphoma developed using Raji cells (Ref: 14) (Fig. 1a). To further investigate the regulatory processes that govern the function of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells in vivo, we delved deeper into these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b). Analyses of differentially expressed genes in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells after infusion revealed notable differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a), with the top upregulated genes including those that encode transcription factors such as CREM, FOS and ASCL2, among others. We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18). Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored. Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterized by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Of note, these cells showed upregulation of genes associated with NK cell inhibition, including ADGRG1, KIR2DL3 and KLRG1 (Fig. 1e). CREM expression in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells remained consistent across all cell cycle stages (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). By contrast, analyses of IL-15 activity using CytoSig showed that it was significantly elevated after infusion (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h) and varied by cell cycle, with the highest levels observed in S phase (Extended Data Fig. 1i). We also observed a significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion, whereby both were increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.\n\nInterpretation: The last sentence is \"Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.\" That's an interpretation. Premise: The findings include \"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples... correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo\", \"Increased expression of effector genes... and genes related to calcium signalling\", \"Upregulation of inhibitory genes\", \"CREM expression remained consistent across cell cycle\", \"IL-15 activity significantly elevated after infusion\", \"positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion\". The connecting principle: maybe the known role of cAMP pathway in immunomodulation and prior knowledge that CREM has inhibitory effects in T cells and macrophages. But the interpretation is that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak activity and is linked to activation and regulation.\n\nWe need to identify components with explicit statements. Let's locate the premise(s) of the interpretation. The interpretation refers to \"CREM is induced...\". The premise is \"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c...)\" and \"correlated with optimal tumour control...\". Also \"positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion\". So there are explicit statements. We can choose one premise per argument (they might expect separate triplets for each logical argument). Here the interpretation covers the same overall conclusion. We could treat the premise as: \"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo\" and \"significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion\". Because we need to pick a single premise per argument? The structure is premise => connecting principle => interpretation.\n\nWe also need a connecting principle. The text earlier mentions \"Given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway\" and \"previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages\". That could serve as connecting principle. Let's see exact wording. \"We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18).\" Also \"Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20)\". So we can use either.\n\nThus for this subsection, we can create at least one triplet:\n\nPremise: \"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14).\" OR also \"We also observed a significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion, whereby both were increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway\" or \"previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages.\" Which is more directly used? The interpretation is about CREM induction and its association with activation/regulatory functions; the cAMP pathway is related to CREM being a transcription factor regulating immunity. So using \"well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway\" is appropriate.\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.\"\n\nThus for this subsection, we can include this triplet. Perhaps there could be more arguments within this subsection. Another potential interpretation: The upregulation of both activation and inhibitory markers suggests a balanced phenotype. But that's included in the above interpretation.\n\nThus provide one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: CAR and IL-15 stimulation induce CREM\n\nRead the text:\n\n> We next asked whether CREM is also induced in CAR-NK cells that target other antigens. To test this possibility, we engineered NK cells to express a CD70-targeting CAR using the CD27 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) (the natural receptor for CD70) fused to CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signalling endodomains without an IL-15 transgene (CAR70; Fig. 1f). We also designed and tested CAR variants with altered signalling: one with mutated CD3\u03b6 ITAM phosphorylation sites (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) and another expressing only the CD27 ECD and therefore without intracellular signalling (CD27(ECD)); Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in non-transduced (NT) NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling (Fig. 1g). This result confirmed the important role of ITAM signalling in CREM induction. We also investigated the effect of IL-15 on CREM induction in NK cells after cytokine starvation. IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent (50\u20135,000 pg ml\u207b\u00b9) increase in CREM expression (Fig. 1h) that was more substantial than with equivalent doses of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and was abrogated by IL-15 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Moreover, stimulation of CAR70 NK cells with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase in CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that both IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) expression and CREM levels increased with elevated IL-15 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2g), with significantly greater CREM expression in IL-15R+ than in IL-15R\u207b NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 2h). We next studied the kinetics of CREM induction after IL-15 stimulation and its relationship with Ki67. Although Ki67 increased at 48 h, CREM expression rose earlier and increased by 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). CREM mRNA was upregulated as early as 6 h, peaked at 24\u201348 h and returned to baseline by 96 h (Extended Data Fig. 2k). This finding indicated the occurrence of transient IL-15-induced expression. However, in our CAR-IL-15 system, in which IL-15 is constitutively secreted, CREM remained consistently high after transduction and after expansion with feeder cells and IL-2 treatment, which indicated that it was stably expressed (Extended Data Fig. 2l). CREM exists in more than 40 isoforms in humans, generated through distinct promoters, transcription factor activity and alternative splicing (Ref: 21). Some isoforms act as activators (for example, CREM\u03c4, CREM\u03c41, CREM\u03c42 and CREM\u03c4\u03b1), whereas others function as repressors (for example, CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2 and CREM\u03b3) depending on the presence or absence of transactivation domains (Ref: 22). By contrast, the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms arise from an alternative promoter, lack transactivation domains and function exclusively as repressors (Ref: 23) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We quantified CREM-specific and ICER-specific transcripts in CAR-NK cells and after IL-15 stimulation (Methods). At baseline, NK cells expressed higher levels of CREM-specific transcripts than ICER-specific transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Compared with NT NK cells, CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed upregulation of CREM-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, ICER-specific exon 2 transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Similarly, IL-15 induced CREM-specific transcripts in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Using an antibody that recognizes all CREM gene products (Ref: 24,25), we confirmed expression of both CREM and ICER isoforms in NK cells, with CAR-IL-15 NK cells showing increased expression of multiple CREM isoforms above 20 kDa, including CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2, CREM\u03b3 and CREM\u03c4 isoforms (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.\n\nInterpretation: The final sentence is \"Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.\"\n\nPremise: Several statements: \"Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in NT NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling.\" That's a direct result. Also \"IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CREM expression\" and \"IL-15 blockade abrogated the increase\". Also \"Stimulation of CAR70 NK cells with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase\". So any of those can be premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"ITAM signalling\" is known to activate signalling, but there's likely an established knowledge that ITAM signalling induces gene expression via certain pathways; also \"cAMP pathway and its role in immunomodulation\" but specifically regarding CREM as downstream of cAMP. However there is no explicit citation in this paragraph about prior knowledge linking ITAM signalling to CREM. The earlier parts mention the cAMP pathway but that's earlier. The connecting principle could be \"CAR ITAM signaling triggers downstream pathways that can induce transcription factors like CREM\". But we need to find explicit statement referencing prior knowledge in this subsection. There is \"Some isoforms act as activators... whereas others function as repressors...\". That is background but about isoforms. There's also \"the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms arise from an alternative promoter, lack transactivation domains and function exclusively as repressors.\" That's a piece of known knowledge.\n\nBut is there a connecting principle linking CAR/IL-15 stimulation to CREM induction? The paragraph does mention that \"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway\", but that is from the next subsection.\n\nIn this subsection, not much connecting principle is explicitly stated. We might consider \"CAR ITAM signalling is known to be a potent activator of downstream signalling pathways\" but it's not explicitly stated. Thus we might mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\". However the problem requires three-part arguments; if connecting principle missing, we should still include but mark as \"(missing)\".\n\nInterpretation was explicit. Premise: \"Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in NT NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling\" (Fig. 1g). That is a premise.\n\nThus we generate a triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in non-transduced (NT) NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling (Fig. 1g).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n- interpretation: \"Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.\"\n\nPotentially we could have another argument focusing on IL-15 dose-dependency, but it's similar. However we may include additional arguments for robustness.\n\nLet's see if there is a separate interpretation about isoform expression: \"These findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM...\". That is the main one.\n\nThus one triplet for this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Cytokines and receptor signalling induce CREM\n\nParagraph:\n\n> We examined the effects of various cytokines on CREM expression. IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response. IL-10 and IL-21 had minimal effects on CREM levels (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To assess the role of ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors, we stimulated NK cells with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp46 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4b), which similarly upregulated CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.\n\nInterpretation: The last sentence: \"These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.\"\n\nPremise: \"IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response.\" And \"IL-10 and IL-21 had minimal effects.\" Also \"Stimulation with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30, anti-NKp46 upregulated CREM expression.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors\" is mentioned, but that's a known concept from immunology, but not explicitly explained. Also \"cytokine-driven activation leads to transcription factor induction.\" There is no explicit citation, but it's generally known. Since no explicit statement about known background, maybe connecting principle missing. However we could use \"ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors is known to activate NK cells\". The text says \"To assess the role of ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors, we stimulated NK cells with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp46 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4b), which similarly upregulated CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c).\" That is an experimental test, not a known principle. I think connecting principle is missing.\n\nThus triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response.\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n- interpretation: \"These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.\"\n\nWe could also include premise about anti-CD16 etc. But maybe one triplet is enough.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells\n\nParagraph:\n\n> We next explored CREM expression in the context of NK cell exhaustion in the tumour microenvironment. Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets from the TISCH2 database revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells, especially NK cells, T cells and monocytes and macrophages, but minimal expression in malignant or stromal cells. Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI-NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially those from bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This pattern held across multiple cancer types in the TI-NK cell atlas, in which CREM was consistently increased in TI-NK cells compared with PBMC NK cells (Ref: 26) (Extended Data Fig. 5b). To further validate these findings, we analysed TI-NK cells from nine patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, including five primary tumours and four metastatic lesions (Ref: 27). CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI-NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and ranked among the top 50 differentially active regulons in the transcriptome of metastatic TI-NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that high CREM expression generally correlated with poor survival in several cancers, including low-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Finally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.\n\nInterpretation: The last sentence: \"Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.\"\n\nPremise: The many observations: \"Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets ... revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells... Tumour-infiltrating NK cells showed higher CREM expression than PBMC NK cells... CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI-NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours... CREM expression correlated with poor survival... CREM enriched in mature NK1 clusters.\"\n\nConnecting principle: The idea that \"high CREM expression correlates with poor survival\" from TCGA is a known correlation, but it's also a result from their analysis, not literature. However \"a more mature NK cell phenotype\" associated with CREM is maybe known from prior work. The text says \"Finally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28).\" That's a literature reference; the statement is a prior known finding that CREM is enriched in mature NK cells. So that could be connecting principle: \"Mature NK1 clusters are associated with certain function and CREM is enriched there (Ref: 28)\".\n\nBut the interpretation is about CREM being prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across cancers and its expression associated with mature NK phenotype. The premise is the observations they just made. The connecting principle is the prior knowledge that mature NK cells are associated with certain phenotype - maybe \"NK cell maturation is associated with functional changes\". However they didn't explicitly state that. There's a reference to \"atlas of NK cell heterogeneity\". So we can treat that as connecting principle: \"CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28).\" That's a known fact.\n\nThus triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets from the TISCH2 database revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells, especially NK cells, ... Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI\u2011NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ... CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI\u2011NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours ... Analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that high CREM expression generally correlated with poor survival in several cancers... Finally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28).\"\n \nBetter to pick a concise premise: perhaps \"CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI\u2011NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and correlated with poor survival in several cancers (Extended Data Fig. 5f).\"\n\n- connecting_principle: \"CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28).\"\n- interpretation: \"Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI\u2011NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.\"\n\nAlternatively, could use the known concept \"Mature NK cells have distinct transcriptional signatures\" but not explicitly mentioned. Use referenced statement.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: CREM shapes the NK cell phenotype\n\nParagraph:\n\n> Next, we performed mass cytometry to determine the phenotype of CREM-expressing NK cells. NK cells expressing IL-15 without a CAR (IL-15 NK cells), CAR70 (no IL-15) or IL-15-secreting CAR70 (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 1i) were cultured together with CD70+ UMRC3 cells. CAR70-IL-15 NK cells consistently expressed the highest levels of CREM, followed by CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Six distinct clusters emerged (clusters 1\u20136), with clusters 1 (highest CREM expression), 2 and 4 predominantly found in CAR70-IL-15, CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells, respectively (Fig. 1j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6d-g). Cluster 1 was characterized by higher levels of activation markers (NKG2D, CD25, CD2, GZMB and perforin) and inhibitory markers (NKG2A, LAG3, TIGIT and TIM3; Fig. 1l). Similar but more moderate patterns were observed in cluster 2 (most abundant in CAR70 NK cells) and cluster 4 (most abundant in IL-15 NK cells). By contrast, cluster 5 (most abundant in NT cells) had a signature of suppression of both activation and inhibitory markers (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 6h). CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i), a result that supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion. Collectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.\n\nInterpretation: The last sentence \"Collectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.\"\n\nAlso earlier \"CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions... supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion.\" That's also an interpretation.\n\nPremise: Observations that \"CAR70-IL-15 NK cells ... expressed highest levels of CREM\", \"Cluster 1 (highest CREM) had higher activation markers and inhibitory markers.\" Also \"CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions.\"\n\nConnecting principle: The known concept that \"activation-induced exhaustion is characterized by co-expression of activation and inhibitory markers\". This might be known. It's not explicitly cited. There's a phrase \"supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion.\" That's a known concept but maybe not explicitly referenced. So connecting principle might be explicit? The text earlier references \"activation-induced exhaustion\" as a concept, but they don't cite a reference. Might be considered missing.\n\nThus we create a triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Cluster 1 (highest CREM expression) was characterized by higher levels of activation markers (NKG2D, CD25, CD2, GZMB and perforin) and inhibitory markers (NKG2A, LAG3, TIGIT and TIM3) (Fig. 1l).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" (since no explicit prior knowledge linking co-expression to exhaustion; though could use \"activation-induced exhaustion is marked by co\u2011expression of activation and inhibitory markers,\" but not cited. It is stated in the sentence \"supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion.\" That's referencing the concept but not a literature citation. However that is a known concept, but is it considered a connecting principle? The phrase is part of the interpretation? \"supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion.\" Might be considered a connecting principle. But we need a statement from literature; no citation. So might be missing. We'll treat as \"(missing)\".\n\n- interpretation: \"Collectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.\"\n\nAlternatively, we could choose the earlier sentence \"CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions... supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation\u2011induced exhaustion.\" That is interpretation. But the final sentence includes the interpretation. We'll stick with that.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis\n\nParagraph synopsis:\n\n> CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30). Thus, to determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation. CAR stimulation resulted in marked CREB phosphorylation in CAR70 NK cells but not in NT or CAR-NK cells with mutated or absent CD3\u03b6 signalling (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F and CD27(ECD), respectively; Fig. 2a,b). These data paralleled previous observations of CREB phosphorylation by PKA downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling (Ref: 31). Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA. Treatment with EGTA led to a consistent suppression of CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Similarly, we observed activation of this pathway in NK cells stimulated through ITAM-associated CD3\u03b6 downstream of CD16, NKp30 and NKp46, which was effectively inhibited by PKA or calcium blockade (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, IL-15 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKA activity (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and pCREB levels in NK cells (Fig. 2e\u2013i), whereas CREB phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in CREM expression were effectively blocked by H89 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) and EGTA (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Together, these data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation. The parallel patterns of CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation or IL-15 stimulation suggested that CREM might be a direct target of CREB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP\u2013qPCR) assays confirmed strong enrichment of CREB on the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a) in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 2k). Similarly, treatment of NK cells with increasing doses of IL-15 led to a dose-dependent increase in binding of pCREB to the CREM promoter (Fig. 2l). These patterns of CREB and pCREB enrichment correlated with CREM transcription levels in these cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 6a), which strongly indicated that CREM is directly regulated by CREB. IL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5. IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in NT NK cells as assessed by western blot analysis, with pSTAT5 showing greater sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). By contrast, CAR activation alone did not induce pSTAT3 or pSTAT5. At baseline, only CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 bands, which was probably driven by autocrine IL-15 signalling (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). To determine the role of STAT3 and STAT5 in IL-15-mediated CREM induction, we assessed CREM expression after IL-15 stimulation in wild-type (WT), STAT3 knockout (KO; Extended Data Fig. 7l), STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5A/B) KO (Extended Data Fig. 7m) and CREM KO NK cells. CREM levels were partially reduced in both STAT3 KO and STAT5A/B KO NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 7n), which indicated that both these factors are involved in CREM induction. ChIP analysis did not reveal significant pSTAT3 binding at the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p). Our findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5). Notably, CREM induction also occurred independently of STAT signalling, specifically after CAR stimulation in the absence of pSTAT3 and pSTAT5, and instead depended on the PKA\u2013pCREB axis (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\n\nInterpretation: The final statement \"These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\" Also earlier \"These data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation.\" So several interpretations.\n\nWe'll treat the interpretation as \"These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\"\n\nPremise: There are several findings: (1) CAR stimulation induced CREB phosphorylation; (2) PKA inhibition blocked CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction; (3) Calcium chelation blocked CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction; (4) IL-15 induced PKA activity and pCREB; (5) H89 blocked IL-15 induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM expression; (6) ChIP\u2013qPCR showed CREB binding to CREM promoter; (7) IL-15 induced pSTAT3 and pSTAT5; (8) STAT3/STAT5 KO partially reduced CREM expression; (9) STAT5B binding to CREM promoter after IL-15.\n\nWe need to pick a premise that is explicitly stated. For example: \"Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d).\" That's a premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM.\" That's a background knowledge connecting cAMP/PKA/CREB to CREM expression. This is a known mechanism referenced (Ref: 29, 30). So that is the connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM.\"\n- interpretation: \"These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\"\n\nAlternatively, could pick a premise about STAT5 involvement. But this is fine.\n\nWe could have separate triplet for STAT5 mechanism: Premise: \"STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p).\" Connecting principle: \"IL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5.\" Interpretation: \"Our findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5).\" That would be another triplet. Might be helpful to include both triplets to capture multiple logical arguments.\n\nThe instructions: identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case. So include all occurrences.\n\nThus for this subsection, at least two triplets.\n\nTriplet 1 (PKA\u2013CREB axis)\n\n- premise_finding: \"Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM.\"\n- interpretation: \"These data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\nBut the interpretation may be \"These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism...\", which includes both axes. However we can separate.\n\nTriplet 2 (STAT3/STAT5 axis)\n\n- premise_finding: \"STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"IL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5.\"\n- interpretation: \"Our findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5).\"\n\nAlso maybe mention partial reduction in CREM expression in STAT3/STAT5 KO NK cells.\n\nThus two triplets.\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO enhances CAR-NK cell potency\n\nParagraph:\n\n> To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells, we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM (an exon shared by most of the non-ICER isoforms) in two CAR-NK cell models: (1) CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d) against CD70+ tumour models (the renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC3, the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line BCX.010 of breast cancer and the Raji cell line of Burkitt lymphoma) and (2) TROP2-targeting CAR-NK cells (CAR.TROP2-IL-15; KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e) against TROP2+ cancer lines (the pancreatic cancer cell line PATC148 and the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3). CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumour spheroid cultures and in tumour rechallenge assays, particularly at low effector-to-target ratios (Fig. 3a\u2013d, Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d and Supplementary Videos 1\u20134). Furthermore, CREM KO enhanced the cytotoxicity of IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in tumour rechallenge assays (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and their ability to produce cytokines (Fig. 3f), with no effect on NT NK cells. Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint. To further elucidate the contributions of CAR signalling and IL-15 on CREM induction, we tested the activity of NK cells expressing different constructs, including IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15, as well as those with impaired (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) or absent (CD27(ECD)) CD3\u03b6 endodomain signalling, on UMRC3 spheroids. CREM KO enhanced CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity in conditions in which CAR activation or IL-15 signalling was present, with the greatest effect observed when both pathways were active (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 3g,h). We tested CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against CD70 KO UMRC3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f). CREM KO enhanced the effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells, regardless of tumour expression of the cognate antigen, but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15 (Extended Data Fig. 8g). This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement. CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells; however, after exposure to increasing concentrations of exogenous IL-15, CREM KO led to enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour targets (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Together, these data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\n\nInterpretation: Several statements: \"Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint.\" Also \"This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement.\" Also \"Together, these data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\nThese are interpretations.\n\nPremise: Observations: \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term ... spheroid cultures and tumor rechallenge assays.\" Also \"CREM KO enhanced cytotoxicity of IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in tumor rechallenge assays and their ability to produce cytokines.\" Also \"CREM KO enhanced CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity in conditions where CAR activation or IL-15 signalling was present, greatest effect when both pathways active.\" Also \"CREM KO enhanced effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells regardless of tumor antigen ... but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15.\" So which premise leads to interpretation that CREM is an intracellular checkpoint? Probably \"CREM KO enhanced cytotoxicity in multiple contexts, particularly when CAR/IL-15 activation present, suggesting that CREM normally restrains activity.\" So premise: \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity ... especially in presence of CAR activation or IL-15 signaling.\"\n\nConnecting principle: The concept that intracellular checkpoints can limit immune cell activity. Possibly known knowledge: \"immune checkpoints restrain T cell activation\" but for NK cells something similar. They might refer to \"intracellular checkpoint\" concept. However no explicit citation. Could be missing.\n\nThus we can create a triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumour spheroid cultures and in tumour rechallenge assays, particularly at low effector-to-target ratios (Fig. 3a\u2013d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" (no explicit prior knowledge linking CREM to checkpoint function; perhaps mention that \"intracellular checkpoints restrain immune cell activity\" is background but not explicitly cited).\n- interpretation: \"Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint.\"\n\nAlternatively, use interpretation: \"This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement.\"\n\nPremise: \"CREM KO enhanced the effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells, regardless of tumour expression of the cognate antigen, but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Inhibitory checkpoints act downstream of activation signals to dampen immune responses.\" Not explicit.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\nWe could also generate a second triplet focusing on IL-15 independent effect: Premise: \"CREM KO enhanced cytotoxicity in NT NK cells after exposure to increasing concentrations of exogenous IL-15.\" Interpretation: \"These data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\nBut maybe we combine.\n\nWe'll provide one triplet for this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell in vivo activity\n\nParagraph:\n\n> We evaluated the impact of CREM KO on CAR-NK cell function in vivo using three different NOD/SCID IL-2R\u03b3null (NSG) mouse models of haematological and solid tumours. To model NK cell exhaustion, we used a mouse model of aggressive CD70+ Raji Burkitt lymphoma and treated these mice with long-term cultured (23\u2011day\u2011old) NT, CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells at a subtherapeutic dose (Fig. 4a). Treatment with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells, NT NK cells or untreated controls (Fig. 4b,c), and resulted in improved survival (Fig. 4d). Moreover, CREM KO led to increased proliferation of CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells in peripheral blood (Fig. 4e) and greater infiltration into the lungs, liver, bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 4f). Notably, the administration of CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells did not cause toxicity, as evidenced by stable body weights in treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also studied the dynamics of ex vivo function and cytokine production of CREM WT and KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells. By day 10 after infusion, CREM WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells acquired a dysfunctional phenotype, with reduced cytotoxicity against targets in Raji and K562 cells compared with the original infusion product (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2011e). By contrast, CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells maintained their cytotoxic function at this early time point (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2011e). However, by day 20, CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells also showed signs of dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2011e). Serum analyses for human cytokines revealed increased levels of TNF, IFN\u03b3, granzyme family members, perforin and other effector molecules in mice treated with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells, particularly at later time points, which indicated different dynamics of cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Extended Data Fig. 9f). In a metastatic CD70+ breast cancer PDX model, NSG mice were engrafted with BCX.010 cells and received intravenous treatment of NT, CREM WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 or CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells 7 days later or were left untreated (Fig. 4g). All mice were euthanized 35 days after NK cell infusion, and tumour burden in the lungs and liver was assessed by histopathology. Mice treated with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells showed significantly lower tumour burden than all control groups (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9g). CREM KO also led to increased proliferation of CAR\u2011NK cells in peripheral blood and greater infiltration into the lungs and liver (Fig. 4i\u2013l), accompanied by elevated GZMB expression, a result consistent with an activated NK cell phenotype (Fig. 4k,l). In an independent experiment using the same model, CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to increased survival of mice compared with controls (Fig. 4m). Notably, treatment with CREM KO cells was well tolerated, with no weight loss observed (Extended Data Fig. 9h), and again led to increased CAR\u2011NK cell proliferation in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 9i). These results were further validated in an orthotopic TROP2+ PATC148 mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Extended Data Fig. 9j). Mice were euthanized 36 days after NK cell infusion for analyses. Intraperitoneal injection of CREM KO CAR.TROP2\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to improved tumour control (Extended Data Fig. 9k) and in vivo systemic persistence (Extended Data Fig. 9l). Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity. We further investigated the safety of CREM KO CAR\u2011NK cells using our BCX.010 mouse model. In brief, mice with BCX.010 tumours were treated intravenously with either CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells. As a control, we infused CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells into mice without tumours. Two weeks later, during active NK cell proliferation, mice were euthanized and histological analyses of major organs (liver, lungs and kidneys) did not show notable abnormalities attributable to NK cell therapy in mice treated with either CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In a separate cohort, blood collected from mice with BCX.010 tumours 30 days after infusion of NK cells did not show significant differences in haematological parameters or serum chemistry between mice treated with CREM WT or KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b\u2011d). In summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR\u2011NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile, thereby highlighting the translational relevance of this approach.\n\nInterpretation: The concluding sentence: \"In summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR\u2011NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile, thereby highlighting the translational relevance of this approach.\"\n\nAlso earlier \"These results were further validated... improved tumour control... increased survival...\".\n\nThus we can extract an interpretation: \"Our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR\u2011NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile.\"\n\nPremise: The findings: \"Treatment with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control... improved survival\" and \"CREM KO also led to increased proliferation... greater infiltration... no toxicity as evidenced by stable body weight etc.\" Also \"No abnormal histology or hematology.\" So we can pick a premise: \"Treatment with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT... and resulted in improved survival.\"\n\nConnecting principle: That \"Targeting inhibitory checkpoints can improve immune cell efficacy but may cause toxicity.\" They mention \"Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity.\" That's a known concept. However they didn't cite. Might be missing. There is also known principle that \"enhanced proliferation and infiltration are associated with improved antitumor efficacy.\" That's implied. But perhaps we use \"Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity\" as connecting principle about safety concerns.\n\nThus triplet:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Treatment with CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells, NT NK cells or untreated controls, and resulted in improved survival (Fig. 4b\u2011d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity.\"\n- interpretation: \"Our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR\u2011NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile.\"\n\nAlternatively, there is also an interpretation about \"CREM acts as intracellular checkpoint.\" But that's earlier.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape\n\nParagraph:\n\n> To understand how CREM modulates CAR-NK cell function, we performed ChIP-seq using an antibody that recognizes all CREM isoforms to identify genome-wide CREM-binding sites in NK cells. CREM binding was detected across numerous genomic sites, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the enrichment of CREM motifs under ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 5a). CREM occupancy was higher in IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells than in NT NK cells (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 11a), a pattern that was also observed for core CREM-binding target genes (Fig. 5c). CREM\u2011bound genes included those relevant to NK cell activity (chemokines and cytokines), cytotoxicity molecules (IFNG, LAMP1 and GZMB), calcium signalling (CAMK1D, CAMK2D and CAMLG) and genes with regulatory function (FOS, FOSB, NFKB2, NFKBIA, STAT3 and EGR1). Some binding targets were unique to specific conditions or shared between similar conditions. For example, DUSP23, DUSP28, EGR4, GZMK, KLRG1, SOCS2 and JUND were common to CAR70 and CAR70\u2011IL\u201115, whereas CCR1, TMEM family members, EOMES and IL\u201113 were shared between IL\u201115 and CAR70\u2011IL\u201115. CISH, SOCS7, NCR1, NCR3, EGR3 and TMEM members were found in all three activated conditions (IL\u201115, CAR70 and CAR70\u2011IL\u201115). Hallmark pathway enrichment analysis of CREM target genes identified the MYC targets V1 as the top pathway enriched among all conditions (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 11b). Other pathways, such as TNF signalling through NF\u2011\u03baB, MTORC1 signalling and G2M checkpoint pathways, were also enriched among the targets in CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells (Fig. 5d). Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue\u2011specific and cell\u2011specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP\u2011seq and RNA\u2011seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells. CREM KO led to both the up\u2011regulation and down\u2011regulation of direct CREM target genes, a result that underscores its context\u2011specific regulatory functions (Extended Data Fig. 11c). Although the specific changes in the direct target genes varied among donors (Extended Data Fig. 11d), consistently down\u2011regulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses, including BTG1 (Ref: 36), DUSP2 (Ref: 37), SMAD3, NFKB2 (Ref: 3) and RGS1 (Ref: 8). Conversely, CREM KO up\u2011regulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2) (Ref: 38,39). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO up\u2011regulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it down\u2011regulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGF\u03b2 signalling (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and up\u2011regulating exhaustion and stress\u2011related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation. To assess the overall impact of CREM on the epigenome, we analysed differences in chromatin accessibility between CREM WT and CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells cultured alone or with UMRC3 cells using assay for transposase\u2011accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC\u2011seq). Overall, CREM WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells displayed reduced chromatin accessibility when cultured together with tumour cells, whereas CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape under the same conditions (Fig. 5f). Notably, CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells cultured together with tumour cells retained accessibility in most cellular metabolic and effector pathways, including MTORC1, PI3K\u2011AKT\u2011MTOR signalling and the mitotic spindle (Extended Data Fig. 11g). Compared with CREM WT, CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility at loci associated with activation of E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M targets, MTORC1 signalling and the mitotic spindle, a result consistent with an effector, activated and proliferating NK cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 11h). Indeed, genes associated with effector function (for example, GZMA and PRF1) and transcription factors essential for NK cell maturation and function (for example, EOMES and TBX21) showed increased accessibility in CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 11i). Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN\u2011related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1\u2011JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells, whereas ETS\u2011related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 11j). These patterns of enriched AP\u20111 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long\u2011lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR\u2011NK cells. To further dissect the mechanisms by which CREM KO improves NK cell function, we first assessed IL\u201115R proximal signalling. Expression of IL\u201115R signalling components was comparable between CREM WT and CREM KO NK cells, with some donor\u2011to\u2011donor variability (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Similarly, levels of negative regulators of IL\u201115R signalling, including SOCS1 and CISH, were not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 12a,c). We next investigated whether CREM KO mirrors the biological effects of IL\u201115R signalling in NK cells, including enhanced proliferation, extended lifespan and improved metabolic fitness. In keeping with our transcriptomic data of up\u2011regulated cell cycle pathways, CREM KO CAR\u2011NK cells showed increased proliferation and extended lifespan, particularly in vivo (Fig. 4e,f,i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9i,l). Moreover, metabolic functional assays revealed enhanced glycolytic capacity and a trend towards increased mitochondrial respiration in CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 12d\u2013i). Taken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state (Fig. 5j). This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation, especially members of the AP\u20111 complex, STAT family and CEBP family (Ref: 41\u201143).\n\nInterpretation: Several concluding statements. For instance: \"Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and up\u2011regulating exhaustion and stress\u2011related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation.\" Also \"Taken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state.\" Also \"This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation.\"\n\nThus multiple interpretations.\n\nPremise: Observations from ChIP-seq and RNA-seq showing CREM binding to various genes; CREM KO leads to upregulation of cytotoxic genes and downregulation of exhaustion genes; ATAC-seq shows chromatin accessibility changes; motif enrichment shows AP-1 enrichment.\n\nConnecting principle: Known concept that transcription factors can act as repressors or activators of gene expression, modulating cell function; also that chromatin accessibility influences gene expression. There is explicit reference: \"Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue\u2011specific and cell\u2011specific expression (Ref: 35).\" That's a prior knowledge.\n\nThus we can capture a triplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and up\u2011regulating exhaustion and stress\u2011related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation.\"\n\nPremise: \"CREM KO led to both the up\u2011regulation and down\u2011regulation of direct CREM target genes... consistently down\u2011regulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses... Conversely, CREM KO up\u2011regulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG.\" Also \"CREM KO CAR70\u2011IL\u201115 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape and increased accessibility at loci associated with metabolic and effector pathways.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue\u2011specific and cell\u2011specific expression (Ref: 35).\" Also maybe \"chromatin accessibility influences gene expression.\"\n\nThus we can select explicit statement: \"Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue\u2011specific and cell\u2011specific expression (Ref: 35).\" That is the connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAlso there might be another interpretation: \"CREM KO improves NK cell function by increasing proliferation and metabolic fitness.\" That could be separate. But we may focus on major one.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\nAlternatively include a triplet for motif analysis: \"These patterns of enriched AP\u20111 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long\u2011lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR\u2011NK cells.\" But need premise: \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN\u2011related factors ... highly enriched in CREM KO...\" and connecting principle: \"AP\u20111 motifs are associated with memory T cell signatures.\" That is prior knowledge (Ref: 40).

offers a promising approach against cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA\u2013CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNK cells have a crucial role in immune surveillance and are able to eliminate abnormal cells independently of major histocompatibility complex class I restriction or antigen priming. Despite their inherent antitumour activity, NK cells often exhibit functional impairment in the tumour microenvironment secondary to immunosuppressive factors and other tumour escape mechanisms. The targeting of checkpoints predominantly linked to T cell dysfunction has resulted in substantial advances in immuno-oncology. However, detailed investigations into the mechanisms that govern NK cell dysfunction are limited. Although the suppressive roles of checkpoints such as TIGIT, TIM3, NKG2A and LAG3 in NK cells are well established, the effects of others such as PD-1 and CTLA4 on NK cells remain controversial. Moreover, research has predominantly focused on the targeting of surface receptors, with limited studies of the role of transcription factors that negatively regulate immune responses. CAR-NK cells have emerged as a promising immunotherapy for both haematological and solid tumours (Ref: 1). Most clinically advanced CAR-NK cell constructs incorporate interleukin-15 (IL-15) to extend the short lifespan of NK cells (Ref: 3). This approach facilitates strong NK cell activation through CAR-associated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signalling after antigen binding, whereas IL-15 promotes proliferation and persistence (Ref: 10). Encouraging clinical outcomes have been reported with NK cells that express both a CD19-directed CAR and IL-15 (CAR19-IL-15) (Ref: 2,3), and CAR-NK cells that target other antigens are in development (Ref: 1). Although some checkpoints of IL-15-mediated NK cell activation have been identified (Ref: 11-13), the mechanisms that regulate NK cell function downstream of combined CAR-associated ITAM and cytokine signalling remain largely unknown. Here we identify the PKA\u2013CREB\u2013CREM axis as a key regulatory pathway in CAR-NK cells that are activated by both IL-15 and CAR signalling. Targeting CREM significantly enhances the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells, thereby offering a new strategy to improve cell therapy.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo\n\nWe have previously shown that CAR19-IL-15 NK cells derived from cord blood exert potent activity in vivo (Ref: 14). We also analysed their single-cell transcriptional signatures after adoptive transfer in a non-curative mouse model of lymphoma developed using Raji cells (Ref: 14) (Fig. 1a). To further investigate the regulatory processes that govern the function of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells in vivo, we delved deeper into these single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b). Analyses of differentially expressed genes in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells after infusion revealed notable differences (Extended Data Fig. 1a), with the top upregulated genes including those that encode transcription factors such as CREM, FOS and ASCL2, among others. We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18). Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored. Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterized by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Of note, these cells showed upregulation of genes associated with NK cell inhibition, including ADGRG1, KIR2DL3 and KLRG1 (Fig. 1e). CREM expression in CAR19-IL-15 NK cells remained consistent across all cell cycle stages (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). By contrast, analyses of IL-15 activity using CytoSig showed that it was significantly elevated after infusion (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h) and varied by cell cycle, with the highest levels observed in S phase (Extended Data Fig. 1i). We also observed a significant positive correlation between IL-15 activity and CREM expression after infusion, whereby both were increased (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions.\n\n> Fig. 1| CREM is induced by CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation. a, Schematic of the in vivo experiment for the scRNA-seq data (Ref: 14) from the Raji mouse model treated with CAR19-IL-15 NK cells (n = 2 mice each, euthanized on day 7 and day 14). i.v., intravenous.

Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. NS, not significant.\n\n### Subsection: CAR and IL-15 stimulation induce CREM\n\nWe next asked whether CREM is also induced in CAR-NK cells that target other antigens. To test this possibility, we engineered NK cells to express a CD70-targeting CAR using the CD27 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) (the natural receptor for CD70) fused to CD28 and CD3\u03b6 signalling endodomains without an IL-15 transgene (CAR70; Fig. 1f). We also designed and tested CAR variants with altered signalling: one with mutated CD3\u03b6 ITAM phosphorylation sites (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) and another expressing only the CD27 ECD and therefore without intracellular signalling (CD27(ECD)); Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells, but not in non-transduced (NT) NK cells or those expressing CARs that lack intracellular signalling (Fig. 1g). This result confirmed the important role of ITAM signalling in CREM induction. We also investigated the effect of IL-15 on CREM induction in NK cells after cytokine starvation. IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent (50\u20135,000 pg ml\u207b\u00b9) increase in CREM expression (Fig. 1h) that was more substantial than with equivalent doses of IL-2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and was abrogated by IL-15 blockade (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Moreover, stimulation of CAR70 NK cells with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase in CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that both IL-15 receptor (IL-15R) expression and CREM levels increased with elevated IL-15 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2g), with significantly greater CREM expression in IL-15R+ than in IL-15R\u207b NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 2h). We next studied the kinetics of CREM induction after IL-15 stimulation and its relationship with Ki67. Although Ki67 increased at 48 h, CREM expression rose earlier and increased by 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). CREM mRNA was upregulated as early as 6 h, peaked at 24\u201348 h and returned to baseline by 96 h (Extended Data Fig. 2k). This finding indicated the occurrence of transient IL-15-induced expression. However, in our CAR-IL-15 system, in which IL-15 is constitutively secreted, CREM remained consistently high after transduction and after expansion with feeder cells and IL-2 treatment, which indicated that it was stably expressed (Extended Data Fig. 2l). CREM exists in more than 40 isoforms in humans, generated through distinct promoters, transcription factor activity and alternative splicing (Ref: 21). Some isoforms act as activators (for example, CREM\u03c4, CREM\u03c41, CREM\u03c42 and CREM\u03c4\u03b1), whereas others function as repressors (for example, CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2 and CREM\u03b3) depending on the presence or absence of transactivation domains (Ref: 22). By contrast, the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) isoforms arise from an alternative promoter, lack transactivation domains and function exclusively as repressors (Ref: 23) (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We quantified CREM-specific and ICER-specific transcripts in CAR-NK cells and after IL-15 stimulation (Methods). At baseline, NK cells expressed higher levels of CREM-specific transcripts than ICER-specific transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Compared with NT NK cells, CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed upregulation of CREM-specific transcripts and, to a lesser extent, ICER-specific exon 2 transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Similarly, IL-15 induced CREM-specific transcripts in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Using an antibody that recognizes all CREM gene products (Ref: 24,25), we confirmed expression of both CREM and ICER isoforms in NK cells, with CAR-IL-15 NK cells showing increased expression of multiple CREM isoforms above 20 kDa, including CREM\u03b1, CREM\u03b2, CREM\u03b3 and CREM\u03c4 isoforms (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity.\n\n### Subsection: Cytokines and receptor signalling induce CREM\n\nWe examined the effects of various cytokines on CREM expression. IL-2, IL-12, IL-18 and IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in CREM, with IL-15 producing the strongest response. IL-10 and IL-21 had minimal effects on CREM levels (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To assess the role of ITAM signalling through endogenous NK cell receptors, we stimulated NK cells with anti-CD16, anti-NKp30 and anti-NKp46 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 4b), which similarly upregulated CREM expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c). These results suggest that CREM upregulation is a general feature of NK cell activation that is driven by both cytokine and ITAM-based signalling and with stimulus-specific differences in strengths and kinetics.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells\n\nWe next explored CREM expression in the context of NK cell exhaustion in the tumour microenvironment. Analyses of scRNA-seq datasets from the TISCH2 database revealed broad CREM expression in tumour-infiltrating immune cells, especially NK cells, T cells and monocytes and macrophages, but minimal expression in malignant or stromal cells. Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI-NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially those from bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This pattern held across multiple cancer types in the TI-NK cell atlas, in which CREM was consistently increased in TI-NK cells compared with PBMC NK cells (Ref: 26) (Extended Data Fig. 5b). To further validate these findings, we analysed TI-NK cells from nine patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, including five primary tumours and four metastatic lesions (Ref: 27). CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI-NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and ranked among the top 50 differentially active regulons in the transcriptome of metastatic TI-NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that high CREM expression generally correlated with poor survival in several cancers, including low-grade glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Finally, CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype.\n\n### Subsection: CREM shapes the NK cell phenotype\n\nNext, we performed mass cytometry to determine the phenotype of CREM-expressing NK cells. NK cells expressing IL-15 without a CAR (IL-15 NK cells), CAR70 (no IL-15) or IL-15-secreting CAR70 (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 1i) were cultured together with CD70+ UMRC3 cells. CAR70-IL-15 NK cells consistently expressed the highest levels of CREM, followed by CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a-c). Six distinct clusters emerged (clusters 1\u20136), with clusters 1 (highest CREM expression), 2 and 4 predominantly found in CAR70-IL-15, CAR70 and IL-15 NK cells, respectively (Fig. 1j,k and Extended Data Fig. 6d-g). Cluster 1 was characterized by higher levels of activation markers (NKG2D, CD25, CD2, GZMB and perforin) and inhibitory markers (NKG2A, LAG3, TIGIT and TIM3; Fig. 1l). Similar but more moderate patterns were observed in cluster 2 (most abundant in CAR70 NK cells) and cluster 4 (most abundant in IL-15 NK cells). By contrast, cluster 5 (most abundant in NT cells) had a signature of suppression of both activation and inhibitory markers (Fig. 1l and Extended Data Fig. 6h). CREM was associated with higher expression of both activation and inhibitory markers across all conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6i), a result that supports the link between CREM induction and a phenotype of activation-induced exhaustion. Collectively, our data support the notion that CREM is preferentially induced by strong NK cell activation, such as through CAR signalling and IL-15 stimulation, and its expression is associated with a complex immunophenotype characterized by both activation and exhaustion.\n\n### Subsection: CREM is induced through the PKA\u2013CREB axis\n\nCREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30). Thus, to determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation. CAR stimulation resulted in marked CREB phosphorylation in CAR70 NK cells but not in NT or CAR-NK cells with mutated or absent CD3\u03b6 signalling (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F and CD27(ECD), respectively; Fig. 2a,b). These data paralleled previous observations of CREB phosphorylation by PKA downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling (Ref: 31). Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA. Treatment with EGTA led to a consistent suppression of CAR-induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction (Fig. 2b\u2013d). Similarly, we observed activation of this pathway in NK cells stimulated through ITAM-associated CD3\u03b6 downstream of CD16, NKp30 and NKp46, which was effectively inhibited by PKA or calcium blockade (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, IL-15 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PKA activity (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and pCREB levels in NK cells (Fig. 2e\u2013i), whereas CREB phosphorylation and the subsequent increase in CREM expression were effectively blocked by H89 (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 7d,e) and EGTA (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Together, these data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA\u2013CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3\u03b6 or IL-15 stimulation. The parallel patterns of CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation or IL-15 stimulation suggested that CREM might be a direct target of CREB. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP\u2013qPCR) assays confirmed strong enrichment of CREB on the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a) in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 2k). Similarly, treatment of NK cells with increasing doses of IL-15 led to a dose-dependent increase in binding of pCREB to the CREM promoter (Fig. 2l). These patterns of CREB and pCREB enrichment correlated with CREM transcription levels in these cells under the same conditions (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 6a), which strongly indicated that CREM is directly regulated by CREB. IL-15 activates NK cells through the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, specifically STAT3 and STAT5. IL-15 induced a dose-dependent increase in pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 in NT NK cells as assessed by western blot analysis, with pSTAT5 showing greater sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i). By contrast, CAR activation alone did not induce pSTAT3 or pSTAT5. At baseline, only CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 bands, which was probably driven by autocrine IL-15 signalling (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). To determine the role of STAT3 and STAT5 in IL-15-mediated CREM induction, we assessed CREM expression after IL-15 stimulation in wild-type (WT), STAT3 knockout (KO; Extended Data Fig. 7l), STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5A/B) KO (Extended Data Fig. 7m) and CREM KO NK cells. CREM levels were partially reduced in both STAT3 KO and STAT5A/B KO NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 7n), which indicated that both these factors are involved in CREM induction. ChIP analysis did not reveal significant pSTAT3 binding at the CREM promoter (promoter 1; Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas STAT5B binding was significantly enriched after IL-15 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7o,p). Our findings indicate that both STAT3 and STAT5 regulate CREM expression, either indirectly (STAT3) or directly through promoter binding (STAT5). Notably, CREM induction also occurred independently of STAT signalling, specifically after CAR stimulation in the absence of pSTAT3 and pSTAT5, and instead depended on the PKA\u2013pCREB axis (Fig. 2b\u2013d and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). These findings collectively highlight a dual mechanism of CREM regulation in CAR-NK cells through the PKA\u2013CREB signalling axis and through STAT3\u2013STAT5 downstream of IL-15.\n\n> Fig. 2| CREM upregulation is mediated through the PKA\u2013pCREB axis. a, Schematic of experiments for b\u2013d.

Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO enhances CAR-NK cell potency\n\nTo determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells, we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM (an exon shared by most of the non-ICER isoforms) in two CAR-NK cell models: (1) CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3d) against CD70+ tumour models (the renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC3, the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell line BCX.010 of breast cancer and the Raji cell line of Burkitt lymphoma) and (2) TROP2-targeting CAR-NK cells (CAR.TROP2-IL-15; KO efficiency is shown in Extended Data Fig. 3e) against TROP2+ cancer lines (the pancreatic cancer cell line PATC148 and the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3). CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumour spheroid cultures and in tumour rechallenge assays, particularly at low effector-to-target ratios (Fig. 3a\u2013d, Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013d and Supplementary Videos 1\u20134). Furthermore, CREM KO enhanced the cytotoxicity of IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in tumour rechallenge assays (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and their ability to produce cytokines (Fig. 3f), with no effect on NT NK cells. Together, these data suggest that NK cell activation through CAR and/or IL-15 stimulation drives CREM expression to act as an intracellular checkpoint. To further elucidate the contributions of CAR signalling and IL-15 on CREM induction, we tested the activity of NK cells expressing different constructs, including IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15, as well as those with impaired (CAR70.3\u03b6.Y6F) or absent (CD27(ECD)) CD3\u03b6 endodomain signalling, on UMRC3 spheroids. CREM KO enhanced CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity in conditions in which CAR activation or IL-15 signalling was present, with the greatest effect observed when both pathways were active (CAR70-IL-15; Fig. 3g,h). We tested CAR-NK cell cytotoxicity against CD70 KO UMRC3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f). CREM KO enhanced the effector function of IL-15-secreting NK cells, regardless of tumour expression of the cognate antigen, but had no effect on CAR70 NK cells without IL-15 (Extended Data Fig. 8g). This result suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation or CAR signalling after antigen engagement. CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells; however, after exposure to increasing concentrations of exogenous IL-15, CREM KO led to enhanced cytotoxicity against tumour targets (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Together, these data point to an important role for CREM as a potent intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains NK cell antitumour activity in response to either CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\n\n> Fig. 3| CREM KO ameliorates CAR-NK cell function. a, Spheroid killing assay of GFP+ UMRC3 cells by CREM WT NT and CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (n = 3 donors).

Scale bars, 400 \u03bcm (b,h).\n\n### Subsection: CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell in vivo activity\n\nWe evaluated the impact of CREM KO on CAR-NK cell function in vivo using three different NOD/SCID IL-2R\u03b3null (NSG) mouse models of haematological and solid tumours. To model NK cell exhaustion, we used a mouse model of aggressive CD70+ Raji Burkitt lymphoma and treated these mice with long-term cultured (23-day-old) NT, CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells at a subtherapeutic dose (Fig. 4a). Treatment with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells led to significantly enhanced tumour control compared with CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, NT NK cells or untreated controls (Fig. 4b,c), and resulted in improved survival (Fig. 4d). Moreover, CREM KO led to increased proliferation of CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in peripheral blood (Fig. 4e) and greater infiltration into the lungs, liver, bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 4f). Notably, the administration of CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells did not cause toxicity, as evidenced by stable body weights in treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a). We also studied the dynamics of ex vivo function and cytokine production of CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. By day 10 after infusion, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells acquired a dysfunctional phenotype, with reduced cytotoxicity against targets in Raji and K562 cells compared with the original infusion product (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). By contrast, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells maintained their cytotoxic function at this early time point (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). However, by day 20, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells also showed signs of dysfunction (Extended Data Fig. 9b\u2013e). Serum analyses for human cytokines revealed increased levels of TNF, IFN\u03b3, granzyme family members, perforin and other effector molecules in mice treated with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, particularly at later time points, which indicated different dynamics of cytotoxicity and cytokine production (Extended Data Fig. 9f). In a metastatic CD70+ breast cancer PDX model, NSG mice were engrafted with BCX.010 cells and received intravenous treatment of NT, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 or CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells 7 days later or were left untreated (Fig. 4g). All mice were euthanized 35 days after NK cell infusion, and tumour burden in the lungs and liver was assessed by histopathology. Mice treated with CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed significantly lower tumour burden than all control groups (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9g). CREM KO also led to increased proliferation of CAR-NK cells in peripheral blood and greater infiltration into the lungs and liver (Fig. 4i\u2013l), accompanied by elevated GZMB expression, a result consistent with an activated NK cell phenotype (Fig. 4k,l). In an independent experiment using the same model, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells led to increased survival of mice compared with controls (Fig. 4m). Notably, treatment with CREM KO cells was well tolerated, with no weight loss observed (Extended Data Fig. 9h), and again led to increased CAR-NK cell proliferation in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 9i). These results were further validated in an orthotopic TROP2+ PATC148 mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Extended Data Fig. 9j). Mice were euthanized 36 days after NK cell infusion for analyses. Intraperitoneal injection of CREM KO CAR.TROP2-IL-15 NK cells led to improved tumour control (Extended Data Fig. 9k) and in vivo systemic persistence (Extended Data Fig. 9l). Targeting inhibitory checkpoints in NK cell activation raises the possibility of unwanted toxicity. We further investigated the safety of CREM KO CAR-NK cells using our BCX.010 mouse model. In brief, mice with BCX.010 tumours were treated intravenously with either CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. As a control, we infused CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells into mice without tumours. Two weeks later, during active NK cell proliferation, mice were euthanized and histological analyses of major organs (liver, lungs and kidneys) did not show notable abnormalities attributable to NK cell therapy in mice treated with either CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In a separate cohort, blood collected from mice with BCX.010 tumours 30 days after infusion of NK cells did not show significant differences in haematological parameters or serum chemistry between mice treated with CREM WT or KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b\u2013d). In summary, our findings support the therapeutic potential of CREM KO to enhance the efficacy of CAR-NK cells in vivo while maintaining a favourable safety profile, thereby highlighting the translational relevance of this approach.\n\n> Fig. 4| CREM KO improves CAR-NK cell efficacy in vivo. a, Schematic of the experimental plan for the Raji mouse model.

Red P values indicate CREM WT versus KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cell group comparisons. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 s.e.m.\n\n### Subsection: CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape\n\nTo understand how CREM modulates CAR-NK cell function, we performed ChIP-seq using an antibody that recognizes all CREM isoforms to identify genome-wide CREM-binding sites in NK cells. CREM binding was detected across numerous genomic sites, and antibody specificity was confirmed by the enrichment of CREM motifs under ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 5a). CREM occupancy was higher in IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells than in NT NK cells (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 11a), a pattern that was also observed for core CREM-binding target genes (Fig. 5c). CREM-bound genes included those relevant to NK cell activity (chemokines and cytokines), cytotoxicity molecules (IFNG, LAMP1 and GZMB), calcium signalling (CAMK1D, CAMK2D and CAMLG) and genes with regulatory function (FOS, FOSB, NFKB2, NFKBIA, STAT3 and EGR1). Some binding targets were unique to specific conditions or shared between similar conditions. For example, DUSP23, DUSP28, EGR4, GZMK, KLRG1, SOCS2 and JUND were common to CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15, whereas CCR1, TMEM family members, EOMES and IL-13 were shared between IL-15 and CAR70-IL-15. CISH, SOCS7, NCR1, NCR3, EGR3 and TMEM members were found in all three activated conditions (IL-15, CAR70 and CAR70-IL-15). Hallmark pathway enrichment analysis of CREM target genes identified the MYC targets V1 as the top pathway enriched among all conditions (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 11b). Other pathways, such as TNF signalling through NF-\u03baB, MTORC1 signalling and G2M checkpoint pathways, were also enriched among the targets in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5d). Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells. CREM KO led to both the upregulation and downregulation of direct CREM target genes, a result that underscores its context-specific regulatory functions (Extended Data Fig. 11c). Although the specific changes in the direct target genes varied among donors (Extended Data Fig. 11d), consistently downregulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses, including BTG1 (Ref: 36), DUSP2 (Ref: 37), SMAD3, NFKB2 (Ref: 3) and RGS1 (Ref: 8). Conversely, CREM KO upregulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2) (Ref: 38,39). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO upregulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it downregulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGF\u03b2 signalling (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 11e,f). Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and upregulating exhaustion and stress-related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation. To assess the overall impact of CREM on the epigenome, we analysed differences in chromatin accessibility between CREM WT and CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured alone or with UMRC3 cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq). Overall, CREM WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells displayed reduced chromatin accessibility when cultured together with tumour cells, whereas CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape under the same conditions (Fig. 5f). Notably, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured together with tumour cells retained accessibility in most cellular metabolic and effector pathways, including MTORC1, PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013MTOR signalling and the mitotic spindle (Extended Data Fig. 11g). Compared with CREM WT, CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility at loci associated with activation of E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M targets, MTORC1 signalling and the mitotic spindle, a result consistent with an effector, activated and proliferating NK cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 11h). Indeed, genes associated with effector function (for example, GZMA and PRF1) and transcription factors essential for NK cell maturation and function (for example, EOMES and TBX21) showed increased accessibility in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 11i). Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1\u2013JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells, whereas ETS-related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 11j). These patterns of enriched AP-1 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells. To further dissect the mechanisms by which CREM KO improves NK cell function, we first assessed IL-15R proximal signalling. Expression of IL-15R signalling components was comparable between CREM WT and CREM KO NK cells, with some donor-to-donor variability (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Similarly, levels of negative regulators of IL-15R signalling, including SOCS1 and CISH, were not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 12a,c). We next investigated whether CREM KO mirrors the biological effects of IL-15R signalling in NK cells, including enhanced proliferation, extended lifespan and improved metabolic fitness. In keeping with our transcriptomic data of upregulated cell cycle pathways, CREM KO CAR-NK cells showed increased proliferation and extended lifespan, particularly in vivo (Fig. 4e,f,i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9i,l). Moreover, metabolic functional assays revealed enhanced glycolytic capacity and a trend towards increased mitochondrial respiration in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 12d\u2013i). Taken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state (Fig. 5j). This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation, especially members of the AP-1 complex, STAT family and CEBP family (Ref: 41-43).\n\n> Fig. 5| CREM drives NK cell dysfunction through transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. a, CREM-binding motif enrichment in CREM ChIP-seq in NT, IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells (n = 3 donors for NT, IL-15 and CAR70 and one donor for CAR70-IL-15 NK cells; Methods). b, UpSet plot of CREM-binding sites in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells from one representative donor. c, Venn diagram of CREM target genes (within 1 kb vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) of a gene) in NT, IL-15, CAR70-IL-15 and CAR70 NK cells, with colours referring to the number of targets (blue, lowest to yellow, highest count). d, Hallmark gene sets enriched among the CREM targets in CAR70-IL-15 NK cells and proportion of genes in each set that were recovered among the targets. e, GSEA enrichment plots of upregulated and downregulated Hallmark pathways (only direct targets of CREM from ChIP\u2013seq were considered in each Hallmark pathway) in CREM KO versus WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells by RNA-seq (n = 2 donors); the red dashed lines indicate the top and bottom of the enrichment score. f, Averaged line graphs and heatmaps showing the ATAC-seq signal intensities surrounding the TSS of all genes in CREM KO and WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with or without UMRC3 cells for 24 h (1:1 E/T ratio; n = 2 donors). g, Chromatin accessibility tracks for select genes in CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells in culture with UMRC3 cells from one representative donor. h, GSEA of transcription factor motif families differentially accessible in CREM KO versus WT CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with UMRC3 cells. i, Motif analyses of top open and closed peaks in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells cultured with UMRC3 cells.

Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle. Across fish, we found a conserved 'interface' transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a). To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients, we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets. Similar to our previous observations (Ref: 6), a subpopulation of human tumour cells highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients (Extended Data Fig. 1d-f). To better understand the nature of these cells, we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states. A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated) (Ref: 2). We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state (Ref: 2). Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8). MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11). Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log\u2082 fold change (FC) = -5.19), TYRP1 (log\u2082FC = -7.75) and PMEL (log\u2082FC = -8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i). These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nWe need to locate three-part arguments. Typically the \"interpretation\" is a sentence like \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" That seems to be an interpretation. The premise is the previous data: \"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development ...\". The connecting principle is perhaps background knowledge: what neuronal development genes indicate a certain phenotype? Possibly they mention that neuronal development genes are markers of invasive state? But we see they say \"Gene set enrichment analysis ... revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells.\" Then \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nBut the connecting principle? Possibly \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching\" and \"cell fate specification and neuronal development are known to be associated with invasive states\". But do they explicitly state that? Not directly; they state GSEA identified enrichment of neuronal development. The linking principle might be \"Cell fate specification and neuronal development programs are linked to invasive phenotypes in melanoma.\" They might not explicitly cite a reference there. However they do reference \"cell fate specification and neuronal development\" as known programs. But that might be considered connecting principle? The text: \"Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i).\" Then \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" So the premise: \"GSEA revealed... cell fate specification and neuronal development pathways enriched.\" The connecting principle: \"Cell fate specification and neuronal development programs correspond to invasive state.\" Not explicit. The phrase \"cell fate specification and neuronal development\" is described as being linked to invasive phenotype? The linking principle may be the earlier statement: \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states.\" That is general knowledge. So the argument likely goes: Premise: Interface cells upregulate neuronal development genes. Connecting principle: Phenotype switching involves transition to undifferentiated/invasive state characterized by loss of melanocytic markers and gain of other markers. Interpretation: Interface cells adopt an invasive neuronal-like state.\n\nThus we can capture a triplet:\n\n- Premise: \"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).\" Additionally GSEA: \"Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states.\" Or perhaps \"Cell fate specification and neuronal development programs are associated with invasive phenotype.\"\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nWe must extract exact text for each component.\n\nPremise_finding: Use the exact phrase: \"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).\" Also GSEA part. Might need to combine into one premise. It's okay to include both lines as separate triplets or unify. Usually one triplet includes a single premise. If needed, we can produce a triplet that includes this premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nMaybe also an earlier interpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" The connecting principle may also be \"Phenotype switching is regulated by transcription factors MITF, SOX9, SOX10.\" Actually they mention those TFs earlier. The premise: \"Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9.\" The connecting principle: \"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation, whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state.\" The interpretation: \"Interface cells adopt an invasive state.\"\n\nThus multiple possible arguments within the subsection.\n\nLet's capture both.\n\nTriplet 1: using MITF etc.\n\n- Premise: \"Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).\"\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" Or perhaps \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state.\" However the interpretation phrase is \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" That could be included.\n\nBut the interpretation as quoted includes neuronal development part, but that is from later part. Possibly we can have separate interpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state.\" But they didn't explicitly phrase that there. The final sentence says \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" So we can use that as the interpretation for both premises.\n\nThus triplet 2: using neuronal development genes.\n\n- Premise: \"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).\" Also \"Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i).\"\n- Connecting principle: Possibly \"Cell fate specification and neuronal development programs are characteristic of undifferentiated/invasive phenotypes.\" Not explicitly stated, but could be considered linking. The text earlier says \"Phenotype switching ... undifferentiated/invasive states.\" But not direct linking to neuronal development. However we can consider \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching\" as the connecting principle. Or \"Transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development are characteristic of the invasive state.\" This is missing? The phrase \"highly enriched in interface cells\" underlines that but doesn't explicitly link to invasive phenotype. I'd argue it's missing but we can treat \"Melanoma behaviour...\" as connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: same final sentence: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nThus in that subsection we have at least two triplets.\n\nWe must extract verbatim text.\n\nNow we need to ensure compliance: The output JSON must have \"subsection\" as the header name exactly: \"Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\". The header name is \"Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\". Or perhaps just \"Tumour gene expression altered by TME\". In the previous examples they used header name. Probably we can just use \"Tumour gene expression altered by TME\". We'll match the header name without \"Subsection:\", but to be safe include the text after \"Subsection:\". The instruction says \"subsection header name\". So we could include exactly \"Tumour gene expression altered by TME\". We'll do that.\n\nNow next subsections.\n\n### Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state\n\nText:\n\n\"To examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state, we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front. Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12). Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in vitro at predefined heights (3 \u00b5m) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips (Ref: 13) (Fig. 1l). Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\"\n\nWe need to find triplets.\n\nInterpretation: \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\" That's the interpretation.\n\nPremise: \"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).\" Also \"Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3).\"\n\nConnecting principle: Possibly \"Tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\" That is a known fact connecting mechanical confinement to nuclear shape changes. Or \"Mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour\" (That's a hypothesis). But the connecting principle should be established knowledge: The earlier sentence \"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\" So that's the principle that mechanical confinement leads to nuclear elongation. However the interpretation is about gene expression changes: \"confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\" So we need a connecting principle about mechanical stress influencing gene expression or pathways. The text does not explicitly cite that principle; they hypothesize it earlier: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\" That's a hypothesis, not established knowledge. But they also have \"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways\". That's the premise. The connecting principle could be the earlier known fact: mechanical confinement leads to nuclear elongation. It is plausible to link nuclear shape changes to changes in gene expression.\n\nThus we can produce a triplet:\n\n- Premise: \"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\"\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\"\n\nAlternatively we could also include the \"Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development\" as premise.\n\nThus we can produce at least one triplet.\n\nPotentially also an earlier interpretation: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\" That's a hypothesis, but it's not exactly a conclusion, but a hypothesis. Yet the instructions require interpretation to be a forward-looking or inferential statement like \"Therefore we hypothesized\". This sentence qualifies; it's stating \"We hypothesized that...\". So this is an interpretation. The premise behind that is the morphological observation of elongated nuclei and the knowledge that mechanical stress can cause nuclear elongation. Or they hypothesize based on prior knowledge. But the structure may be: Observation: Nuclei elongated. Principle: Tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing (Ref:12). Interpretation: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\" That seems an interpretation, but it's a hypothesis. However they want \"interpretation first\". It could be considered as inference/hypothesis.\n\nThus we could have a triplet:\n\n- Premise: \"Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\"\n- Interpretation: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\"\n\nThus we have a second triplet.\n\nNow also they later do in vitro confinement: \"Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic ... To profile ...\". The interpretation \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\" That's separate.\n\nThus we have at least two triplets in this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n\nText (long):\n\n\"Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function (Ref: 14). The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli (Ref: 15). Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16). We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment. We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16). We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14,17). These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons. Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs (Ref: 18). Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19). Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs (Ref: 19). We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAFV600E-driven melanomas and observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border (Fig. 2c-e). Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 2f-h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved-again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g). We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus. As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage (Ref: 20,21). During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23). We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism (Ref: 24). Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19). Nocodazole (1 \u00b5M) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j). We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton. In addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability (Ref: 25). To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network, we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells. Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26). However, most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27). Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network. These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\nWe need to find triplets.\n\nInterpretations: There are at least several such sentences that start with \"These results indicate...\" or \"This indicates...\" and \"These data indicate...\".\n\nPotential interpretations:\n\n1. \"These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\"\n\n2. \"This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.\"\n\n3. \"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\n4. Possibly also earlier \"We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment.\" That's a hypothesis, not derived from data, but it's a forward-looking statement. Could be considered interpretation (but it's a hypothesis). It appears before any data presented. Might be considered a prior hypothesis, not a conclusion.\n\nWe need to select those where the interpretation is based on preceding data.\n\nLet's parse each.\n\nInterpretation 1: \"These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\"\n\n- Premise: Evidence: \"Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).\" Also \"We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons...\" So the premise is those observations.\n\n- Connecting principle: \"Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture... The cytoskeleton often transmits force... Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16).\" Or more specific: \"MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16).\" This is used to link the observed MT remodeling to neuronal-like changes. So the connecting principle likely: \"MT bending and remodeling in response to force is known to protect cells and is observed in neurons.\" But that's a known principle. The text: \"This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16).\" That's the connecting principle.\n\nThus we can create a triplet.\n\nInterpretation 2: \"This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.\"\n\n- Premise: \"We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e).\"\n\n- Connecting principle: Possibly \"Acetylation of tubulin stabilizes MTs and protects against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).\" That is a known principle: \"Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure.\"\n\nThus the interpretation is that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase responding to mechanical stress.\n\nInterpretation 3: \"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\n- Premise: Observations: \"We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole... many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage.\" Also \"We observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border (Fig. 2c-e).

We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinement-induced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28). Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma (Ref: 2), their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells (Ref: 6). HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells (P = 3.24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2077; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h). To validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P=0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase (P = 3.01 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2-GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2-GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members. We examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2\u207a and AcTub\u207a), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub\u207aand HMGB2\u207b), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2\u207a nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub\u207b and HMGB2\u207a) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates the scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c). We then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types. We focused on two cancer types probably influenced by mechanical stress in vivo: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer. In both, confinement induced significant upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6f-q). Mechanical stress can be associated with nuclear translocation of transcription factors, such as YAP, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers, including Twist, Snail and SMAD3 (Ref: 30). To rule out a potential pro-invasive role for these transcription factors upon mechanical stress in melanoma, we quantified their expression in confined A375 cells. None of the factors examined (YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3) exhibited nuclear translocation upon confinement, and the nuclear expression of YON, Twist and SMAD3 decreased (Extended Data Fig. 7).\"\n\nInterpretations: There are several explicit statements such as:\n\n- \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n- \"These data indicate ... interface cells are present in human samples\" (but the interpretation is about presence of interface cells).\n- \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" is an interpretation (conclusion that confinement causes upregulation).\n\n- Also earlier: \"Our results indicate that confinement induces a neuronal identity in interface melanoma cells.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nBut we need to pair them with premise and connecting principle.\n\nOne clear inference: \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" That is a conclusion.\n\nPremise: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).\" Also \"HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 3g).\" Also \"In vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Fig. 3h,i).\" The connecting principle: \"HMG-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\" Or \"Mechanical pressure on cells leads to activation of certain pathways.\" We could use the principle: \"High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\" That links mechanical stress to HMGB2 involvement. So we have a triplet.\n\nInterpretation also: \"This validates the scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples.\" That's a conclusion about validation. Premise: \"Human melanoma tissue microarray showed elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin in many samples.\" Connecting principle: maybe \"Interface cells are defined by elongated nuclei, high HMGB2, and acetylated tubulin\" (implied). However they didn't state that as established knowledge. Might be missing.\n\nAlso the statement: \"None of the factors examined (YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3) exhibited nuclear translocation upon confinement, and the nuclear expression of YAP, Twist and SMAD3 decreased.\" That is an observation (premise). The interpretation: \"To rule out a potential pro-invasive role for these transcription factors upon mechanical stress in melanoma, we quantified their expression...\" Actually that is the purpose, not conclusion. The conclusion is that these factors are not involved. But there is no explicit \"Thus\" statement. Could be interpreted as \"These data suggest that YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3 are not responsible for the observed phenotype.\" But not explicit.\n\nThus the most clear triplet is the HMGB2 upregulation conclusion. Also earlier \"These results indicate that confinement induces a neuronal identity in interface melanoma cells\" but that belongs to previous subsection.\n\nThus we can extract at least one triplet.\n\nTriplet:\n\n- Premise: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\" (Or possibly \"Confinement exerts mechanical pressure on cells.\" but that is known.)\n- Interpretation: \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nWe should use the verbatim phrase \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" That's the interpretation.\n\nBut maybe we want the full phrase: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" Actually the interpretation appears as a clause after that observation. That can be separated: The interpretation is that clause. Good.\n\nNow we might also have a triplet for \"HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity... indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" However that would duplicate.\n\nNow also a triplet about \"HMGB2 upregulation is not a general property of all HMG family members.\" But that is a conclusion that HMGB2 is specific. Premise: \"We examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1... and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f).\" Connecting principle: Possibly \"HMG family proteins have variable responses to mechanical stress...\" Not explicit. So may skip.\n\nThus one triplet for this subsection.\n\nNow next subsection.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2\n\nText:\n\n\"To investigate how mechanical confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation, we focused on the MT cytoskeleton, hypothesizing that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network (Fig. 2f,g) may propagate confinement-induced force to the nucleus. To confirm that the perinuclear network is upstream of HMGB2 enrichment in the confinement response, we generated stable A375 cell lines in which HMGB2 was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c). Upon confining two different A375-HMGB2KO cell lines, we confirmed that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). We modulated tubulin dynamics and acetylation state in confined cells to determine whether the acetylated tubulin network influences HMGB2 upregulation. Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (Ref: 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (Ref: 32). We first treated A375 cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin (Ref: 33), which increased tubulin acetylation without affecting histone acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 9a-f). In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 \u00b1 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Extended Data Fig. 9i). To stabilize MTs independent of acetylation, we treated confined cells with paclitaxel (Taxol), which binds \u03b2-tubulin and prevents tubulin monomer incorporation into MT filaments and thus should not influence the acetylation state of HMGB2 or other proteins (Ref: 34). Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 \u00b1 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects of tubacin on HMGB2, similar results in Taxol-treated and tubacin-treated cells indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions. To confirm the role of perinuclear acetylated tubulin in mediating HMGB2 accumulation, we treated A375[HMGB2-GFP] cells with nocodazole before applying confinement. Nocodazole abolishes most MT networks, with the exception of stabilized acetylated tubulin filaments (Ref: 24). Because the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage was resistant to nocodazole (Fig. 2i,j), nocodazole treatment allowed us to specifically interrogate the contribution of acetylated MTs to HMGB2 upregulation in confined cells. We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j) and HMGB2-GFP accumulation was unaffected (P = 0.714; Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). We quantified HMGB2 accumulation in confined A375-ATAT1KO cells lacking acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). Unexpectedly, HMGB2 accumulation was not impaired in ATAT1KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f), suggesting that acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement. Thus, we investigated other factors that may cooperate with the MT cytoskeleton to promote upregulation of HMGB2 in confined cells using TurboID (Ref: 35) to perform proximity labelling proteomics targeting HMGB2 interactors (Fig. 3l and Supplementary Table 4). One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2 (gene name: SYNE2), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36) (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesized that nesprin 2 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement. Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2. The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36). Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\u00b2; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\"\n\nWe need to extract triplets.\n\nInterpretations: Several statements preceded by \"Thus... indicates...\", \"We hypothesized...\", but the interpretation must be a conclusion that follows premises.\n\nPossible interpretations:\n\n- \"This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\n- \"These results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\"\n\n- \"Thus, we investigated other factors... One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2...\" That is a step, not an interpretation.\n\n- \"Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 ... targeting SYNE2 ... abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2...\" The conclusion is that nesprin 2 is required for HMGB2 accumulation. That is explicit: \"This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\nInterpretation 1: \"This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\n- Premise: \"Targeting SYNE2 with siRNA abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).\"\n\n- Connecting principle: \"Nesprin 2 is a component of the LINC complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36).\" Or \"The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).\" This is known background.\n\nThus we can construct a triplet.\n\nInterpretation 2: \"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\"\n\n- Premise: Several observations: \"Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\u00b2; ...), and AFM showed increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells\" plus \"Targeting SYNE2 abolished HMGB2 accumulation\" etc.\n\n- Connecting principle: \"The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).\" Also \"Nesprin 2 is a component of the LINC complex connecting cytoskeleton to chromatin.\"\n\nThus interpretation is general conclusion.\n\nInterpretation 3: \"We hypothesized that nesprin 2 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement.\" That's a hypothesis, not a conclusion derived.\n\nInterpretation 4: \"Thus, we investigated other factors ... One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2.\" That is not conclusion.\n\nThus at least two triplets.\n\nAlso earlier there is an interpretation \"These results indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions.\" That is a conclusion.\n\nInterpretation 5: \"These results indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions.\"\n\n- Premise: Observation that tubacin and Taxol both increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells; tubacin increases acetylation; Taxol stabilizes MTs independent of acetylation. Both increased HMGB2. So premise: \"Tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation...Taxol also significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation.\" Also \"Nocodazole treatment abolished MT network but left acetylated tubulin network and HMGB2 accumulation unaffected.\" Wait that indicates that acetylated tubulin is not necessary.\n\n- Connecting principle: \"MT stability influences signaling pathways that modulate nuclear proteins.\" Not explicitly stated, but maybe \"MT stability is known to affect nuclear processes.\" However they might implicitly use an established principle: \"Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).\" That is a known principle linking acetylation to stability.\n\nThus this can be a triplet.\n\nThus we may have multiple triplets. We need to extract them. However the instruction says \"identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case.\" So we need to identify all such instances. The challenge: there are many arguments. We should aim to capture as many as possible, but also stay within reasonable output size. No explicit limit. However we need to be thorough.\n\nWe can produce at least three triplets for this subsection: (1) about nesprin 2 requirement, (2) about MT stability linking to HMGB2, (3) about overall remodeling and nuclear stiffening.\n\nNow next subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n\nText:\n\n\"Our results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2. HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37). Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize nuclear HMGB2 dynamics upon confinement. As previously reported (Ref: 38), HMGB2-GFP was highly dynamic even in unconfined cells (Fig. 4a-d), with only approximately 25% stably bound within the nucleus (mobile fraction = 75.21 \u00b1 0.91%). In both conditions, FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two-component exponential equation (average coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) = 0.986 \u00b1 0.00054; Fig. 4d,e and Methods), indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39). Although more than 90% of HMGB2 remained fast-diffusing in both conditions, confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075; Fig. 4f), suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nPremise: \"Confined cells significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76% vs 4.21%; P=...).\" So the observation is the FRAP data.\n\nConnecting principle: \"HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).\" Also could be \"Two-component exponential fit indicates fast and slow pools; slow pool corresponds to more stable interactions.\" But the connecting principle could be \"Slower diffusion in FRAP indicates more stable DNA binding.\"\n\nThus we have a triplet.\n\nAlso earlier: \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.\" This is a hypothesis linking shape changes to strain.\n\nInterpretation: \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.\" That is not a conclusion but a plausible mechanism. However it's an interpretation as a statement about what might happen. It is forward-looking: \"could thus increase.\" Might be considered an interpretation.\n\nPremise: The shape changes are known: \"confinement-induced nuclear shape changes.\" But the text earlier indicated \"HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = -0.474; ...)\", or \"Confinement induced nuclear shape changes.\" The premise of shape changes could be indicated though not directly in this paragraph. However we could use the premise from earlier: \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes.\" But it's not explicitly stated in this paragraph; they refer to earlier results. So it may be implicit. The connecting principle: \"HMGB2 binds chromatin and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).\" The conclusion is the sentence about how shape changes affect HMGB2 dynamics; but it's a suggestion. Might be okay.\n\nNevertheless at least one triplet is clear.\n\nThus we can produce a triplet as above.\n\nNow next subsection.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci\n\nText:\n\n\"Our FRAP analysis indicates that confinement upregulates HMGB2 and stabilizes its interactions with chromatin; therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g). Peak-gene mapping and pathway analysis revealed that open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes, with increased accessibility at loci linked to the neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h-j and Supplementary Table 5). Homer de novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2OE). The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u2079), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41). Other highly ranked motifs included PRDM4, which functions in neural development (Ref: 42) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2), and SOX9, a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma (Ref: 43) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9). These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program.\"\n\nInterpretations: The concluding sentence: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program.\" That's an interpretation.\n\nPremise: The ATAC-seq data: \"ATAC sequencing of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility.\" Also \"Peak-gene mapping ... open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes...\". Also motif analysis identified AP-1, PRDM4, SOX9 motifs.\n\nConnecting principle: \"AP-1 is implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).\" Also \"PRDM4 functions in neural development (Ref: 42).\" \"SOX9 is a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma (Ref: 43).\" Those are known background linking transcription factors to plasticity and neuronal development. So the background principle that AP-1, PRDM4, and SOX9 are central to plasticity and neuronal phenotypes. We can pick one connecting principle, perhaps \"AP-1 motif is implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).\" That is an established link.\n\nThus we have a triplet.\n\nAlso earlier: \"Therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility.\" That is a hypothesis. Interpretation? The \"Therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility.\" That's interpretation, but it's not a conclusion from data.\n\nThus include the explicit conclusion.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nNow next subsection.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2\n\nText:\n\n\"Phenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors (MITF) driving proliferation versus invasive factors (BRN2, SOX9 and AP-1) that also slow proliferation. We investigated whether HMGB2 drives invasion through these factors. Using the SKMEL5 melanocytic cell line, we created a stable line expressing V5-tagged HMGB2 and performed ChIP-seq targeting V5 and HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a). We generated a peak atlas containing 1,361 peaks corresponding to 1,286 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 8). We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the MITF promoter (Extended Data Fig. 12c). However, loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log\u2082FC = 0.157; Extended Data Fig. 12e-g and Supplementary Table 9), indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead. HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells. Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells (DLL1, DLL3 and DLK2; Supplementary Table 1) and confined human melanoma cells (NOTCH2NLA, DLK2 and DLL4; Supplementary Table 2). Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50). This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling. Supporting this model, a BRN2/POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Although MITF and BRN2 expressions are often inversely correlated (Ref: 1), previous reports (Ref: 52,53) and our data indicate that these factors can also be co-expressed. Characterizing the mechanisms that control the expression of these factors and the regulation of the proliferative/invasive trade-off will be an important area for future investigation.\"\n\nInterpretations: Several statements of interpretation include:\n\n- \"This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.\"\n\n- \"loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression ..., indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead.\"\n\n- Also \"Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2)... This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes... are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation...\"\n\nThus we can extract at least two triplets.\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression ..., indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead.\"\n\nPremise: ChIP-seq shows robust HMGB2 binding to MITF promoter; loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log\u2082FC = 0.157). (the second part is the result, the first part is the binding but the point is that loss didn't affect expression.)\n\nConnecting principle: \"Phenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors (MITF) driving proliferation versus invasive factors (BRN2, SOX9 and AP-1) that also slow proliferation.\" This is known background linking MITF to proliferation and BRN2 to invasion.\n\nThus the conclusion states that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors rather than MITF.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.\"\n\nPremise: \"HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 and SKMEL5 cells.\" Also \"Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells and confined human melanoma cells.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50).\" This is known background establishing Notch/BRN2 link to invasion.\n\nThus we have two triplets.\n\nPotential also: \"Supporting this model, a BRN2/POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes.\" That's more support, not a conclusion.\n\nThus we capture these.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching\n\nText:\n\n\"One prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative (Fig. 5a). Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity. Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b). To visualize the influence of confinement on this trade-off, we generated an A375 cell line stably expressing the FastFUCCI cell cycle sensor (Ref: 54). Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells (mAG\u207a and S/G2-M phase) rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit (Fig. 5c,d). To directly test the role of HMGB2 in melanoma invasion, we used in vitro invasion assays (Fig. 5e) and found that targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion (P = 0.0133; Fig. 5f,g), whereas overexpression of HMGB2 increased invasion (P = 0.0180; Fig. 5h,i). Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55-57). We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b5m min\u207b\u00b9; Extended Data Fig. 13a-c), which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system. To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in vivo, we generated BRAFV600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR. Loss of hmgb2a and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks (P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j-l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m). These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state. HMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail regions (Extended Data Fig. 14a). We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma. We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c). We were unable to express a truncated construct lacking both DNA-binding domains, probably because of its small size (24 amino acids). In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2; this was probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f). Because we were unable to generate constructs lacking both DNA-binding domains, when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j), demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\"\n\nInterpretations:\n\n- \"These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state.\"\n\n- Also earlier: \"Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity.\" That's a conclusion.\n\n- Also \"cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative but more invasive ... demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nWe need to find premises for each.\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state.\"\n\nPremise: \"Loss of hmgb2a and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth ... while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m).\" Also earlier \"targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion; overexpression increased invasion.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"One prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative (Fig. 5a).\" This is known background.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative but more invasive ... demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\"\n\nPremise: Experimental data: \"In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Fig. 14e).\" Also \"when transplanted into mice, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates ... or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front ... demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"HMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail region.\" That is known structure. Also perhaps \"DNA-binding domains are essential for HMGB2 function.\" That is known.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nTriplet 3:\n\nInterpretation: \"Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity.\"\n\nPremise: \"Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b).\" Also \"Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"One prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative.\" That's the background.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nThus we can produce three triplets.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance\n\nText:\n\n\"Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2). This has important clinical relevance because drug-tolerant persister cells are major contributors to relapse (Ref: 59). We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response, hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance. To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs. Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60), indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation. We then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in vivo by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib, widely used targeted therapies in melanoma (Ref: 61) (Fig. 5n). HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10). Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15).\"\n\nInterpretations:\n\n- \"We hypothesized that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance.\" That's a hypothesis, but it's an interpretation? It's a forward-looking statement.\n\n- \"Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest, indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation.\" That's an interpretation.\n\n- \"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo.\" That's a result; not interpretation. But the overarching conclusion: \"Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma.\" That's an interpretation.\n\nThus we can extract at least two triplets.\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation.\"\n\nPremise: \"Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60).\" Also \"Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Cell cycle arrest leads to apoptosis (for unconfined cells) and confinement may cause cell cycle exit.\" Or more general: \"Taxol's mechanism is cell cycle arrest leading to cell death.\" That is known.\n\nThus we can pair.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma.\"\n\nPremise: \"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043).\" Also \"Confined cells were resistant to Taxol-induced cell death.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2).\" That's known.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nTriplet 3 (maybe): \"We hypothesized that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance.\"\n\nPremise: The observations that HMGB2-high neuronal state exists in confined cells; perhaps no explicit premise here, but they have data showing HMGB2 upregulation and neuronal markers. However that may be implicit. Could be excluded.\n\nThus we include at least two triplets.\n\nNow we have to produce JSON.\n\nWe must produce array of objects, each with \"subsection\": \"...\", \"triplets\": [list of triplet objects].\n\nWe need to include each subsection present in the Results, i.e., all headings from the Results.\n\nFrom the excerpt, the headings are:\n\n- Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\n- Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state\n- Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n- Subsection: Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2\n- Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2\n- Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n- Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci\n- Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2\n- Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching\n- Subsection: HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance\n\nThus we need to include all.\n\nNow compile the triplets for each.\n\nWe'll need verbatim extraction for each component. Let's capture exact quotes.\n\n## Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\n\nTriplet 1 (MITF, SOX9 connection)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nBut note that the interpretation line mentions neuronal development, not just invasive state. But it's okay.\n\nTriplet 2 (neuronal development genes)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states.\" Or \"Phenotype switching involves the undifferentiated state characterized by loss of melanocyte markers and gain of alternative programs.\" It might be more appropriate: \"Phenotype switching is regulated by transcription factors MITF, SOX9, ... The undifferentiated invasive state is associated with neuronal development markers.\" However the connecting principle as given: \"Phenotype switching is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10 ...\" which is present earlier. That may be considered a connecting principle. But the specific text: \"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).\" That's more specific. However this is same as previous connecting principle. Could reuse. Since we need to include explicit text.\n\nThus for triplet 2, we can use same connecting principle: \"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).\" That is a known principle linking transcription factors.\n\nInterpretation: \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\"\n\nAlternatively, the interpretation could be \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" This works.\n\nThus we have two triplets.\n\n## Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state\n\nTriplet 1 (Observation of elongated nuclei leading to hypothesis)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\"\n\nTriplet 2 (Confinement upregulates neuronal pathways)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).\" (But maybe more appropriate to use the same connecting principle about mechanical confinement leading to nuclear changes. However linking to neuronal pathways is less direct. Could use \"Mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression.\" That is the hypothesis statement, not a known principle; but it's present earlier. Or we can use \"Mechanical confinement influences gene expression in a way that resembles the interface state.\" Not explicit. Maybe we need another connecting principle: \"Pathway analysis showed many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development.\" That's not a principle, it's a result.\n\nAlternatively, the connecting principle could be omitted or marked as missing. However the instruction: if the connecting principle is not explicitly stated, mark as `(missing)`. In this case there is no explicit statement linking neuronal pathway upregulation to confinement, aside from the earlier morphological hypothesis. The more explicit principle is about nuclear elongation. However it might be considered connecting principle for the overall link between confinement and phenotype. It's a stretch but we can include.\n\nThus we can write connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" if not explicit.\n\nBut this is ambiguous. Since the instruction is strict: This component must be explicit; else mark as `(missing)`. Since no explicit statement linking neuronal pathways to confinement is present, we could use `(missing)`. However the sentence \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\" might be considered a connecting principle: It states that mechanical forces cause changes in gene expression. That's a prior hypothesis, not a citation to external literature, but it's a statement. However it's a hypothesis, not established knowledge. It may count as a connecting principle? It is a logical bridge linking the premise of increased neuronal pathways to mechanical forces. But it's also a hypothesis that they present; the instructions say connecting principle is a statement of pre-existing knowledge, with citations to other work. This sentence is not referencing external literature. So it's not a known principle. So we should mark `(missing)`.\n\nThus Triplet 2:\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\"\n\nThus we have two triplets.\n\n## Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n\nTriplet 1 (MT remodeling resembles neurons)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\"\n\nTriplet 2 (Acetylated tubulin network role)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 2f-h).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\nTriplet 3 (ATAT1 as acetyltransferase)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).\" (Same principle). Or \"Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19).\" But the principle about ATAT1 being responsible for acetylation is known but not cited. The text \"ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.\" This is a conclusion from their data. The connecting principle might be missing.\n\nBetter to have a different triplet.\n\nTriplet 3 could be about PTMs:\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26).\" Or \"Tyrosination is common in melanoma due to high tyrosine levels.\" That is a background.\n\n- Interpretation: \"This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.\"\n\nThus we have a triplet.\n\nTriplet 4 (MT stability linked to HMGB2 - but that belongs to next subsection maybe). But we can keep this as is.\n\nThus for this subsection we have three triplets.\n\n## Subsection: Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2\n\nTriplet 1 (HMGB2 upregulation due to confinement)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nActually the phrase includes \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" That's the interpretation. But we need to separate premise and interpretation. The premise is the observation: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).\" The interpretation is \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nThus:\n\n- Premise_finding: \"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\"\n\nTriplet 2 (In vitro confinement leads to HMGB2 increase)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"The in vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Fig. 3h,i).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\" Or can reuse; but may be considered same.\n\n- Interpretation: \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" But this same interpretation appears; we could avoid duplicate. Actually the interpretation phrase appears only once. In the second part they also mention normalization to Hoechst still shows increase, thus \"indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.\" The same phrase is used. We could combine but maybe treat as separate instance.\n\nAlternatively we can have another interpretation: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 is specifically upregulated by confinement, unlike other HMG family members.\"\n\nBut that phrase is: \"indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nThus Triplet 3:\n\n- Premise_finding: \"We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1 ... and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).\" Actually that is background for all HMG proteins. But the conclusion is about specificity.\n\n- Interpretation: \"indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.\"\n\nThus we can have two or three triplets.\n\nProbably include the first and third.\n\nWe'll include two triplets: one about HMGB2 upregulation, one about specificity.\n\nThus two triplets.\n\n## Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2\n\nTriplet 1 (Nesprin 2 required for HMGB2 accumulation)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Nesprin 2 is a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\nTriplet 2 (MT stability linked to HMGB2 accumulation)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; ... ) and the rate of accumulation ...; Taxol ... significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230; ...).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).\" Also \"MT stabilization influences nuclear processes.\" The first part is explicit.\n\n- Interpretation: \"These results indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions.\"\n\nTriplet 3 (Overall remodeling leads to HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells ... and AFM showed increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells.\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\"\n\nThus three triplets.\n\n## Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n\nTriplet 1 (FRAP shows increased stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075; Fig. 4f).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"Two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\"\n\nTriplet 2 (Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could affect HMGB2 dynamics)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.\" Actually this statement is partly interpretation. The premise may be prior observation: \"Our results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2.\" That is observation. The connecting principle: \"HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).\" Interpretation: The sentence \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.\" That's more of a hypothesis, but could be taken as interpretation.\n\nBetter to treat this as interpretation, premise of nuclear shape changes is from previous sections, connecting principle is HMGB2 function. However the exact phrase may be considered as interpretation. Let's include this as a triplet.\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Our results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2.\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.\"\n\nThus we have two triplets.\n\n## Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci\n\nTriplet 1 (ATAC-seq shows increased accessibility at neuronal loci)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"ATAC sequencing of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g).\"\n\n- Connecting_principle: \"AP-1 motif is implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program.\"\n\nAlternatively, we could include also motif identification for PRDM4 and SOX9 as connecting principles, but we'll keep AP-1.\n\nTriplet 2 (Enriched neuronal gene motifs)\n\n- Premise_finding: \"Homer de novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2OE).

The same phrase appears for both; but it's okay.\n\nAlternatively we could have second interpretation \"These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\" It's identical; it's okay maybe.\n\n**Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state**\n\nTriplet 1 interpretation: \"We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\"\n\nTriplet 2 interpretation: \"These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\"\n\n**Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton**\n\nTriplet 1 interpretation: \"These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\"\n\nTriplet 2 interpretation: \"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\"\n\nTriplet 3 interpretation: \"This indicates that acetylated tubulin is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.\" Actually the interpretation sentence was: \"This indicates that acetylated tubulin is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.\" Let's verify text: \"This indicates that acetylated tubulin is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.\" Yes.

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME\n\nTo study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion, we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma (Fig. 1a). Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle. Across fish, we found a conserved 'interface' transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a). To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients, we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets. Similar to our previous observations (Ref: 6), a subpopulation of human tumour cells highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients (Extended Data Fig. 1d-f). To better understand the nature of these cells, we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states. A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated) (Ref: 2). We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state (Ref: 2). Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8). MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11). Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log\u2082 fold change (FC) = -5.19), TYRP1 (log\u2082FC = -7.75) and PMEL (log\u2082FC = -8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log\u2082FC = 5.15), NNAT (log\u2082FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log\u2082FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log\u2082FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i). These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\n\n> Fig. 1| Confinement induces an undifferentiated neuronal gene program. a, Schematic detailing the workflow of spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq experiments performed on zebrafish melanomas. b, Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset from Jerby-Arnon et al.\u2077.

Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12). Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in vitro at predefined heights (3 \u00b5m) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips (Ref: 13) (Fig. 1l). Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\n\n### Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n\nNeuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function (Ref: 14). The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli (Ref: 15). Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16). We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment. We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16). We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14,17). These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons. Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs (Ref: 18). Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19). Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs (Ref: 19). We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAFV600E-driven melanomas and observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border (Fig. 2c-e). Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 2f-h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved-again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g). We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus. As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage (Ref: 20,21). During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23). We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism (Ref: 24). Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19). Nocodazole (1 \u00b5M) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j). We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton. In addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability (Ref: 25). To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network, we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells. Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26). However, most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27). Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network. These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage assembles in response to confinement. a, Representative stills from confocal imaging of A375 cells stained with SiR-tubulin.

We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinement-induced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28). Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma (Ref: 2), their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells (Ref: 6). HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells (P = 3.24 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2077; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h). To validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity (R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells (P = 1.42 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P=0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase (P = 3.01 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2-GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2-GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members. We examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2\u207a and AcTub\u207a), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub\u207aand HMGB2\u207b), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2\u207a nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub\u207b and HMGB2\u207a) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates our scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c). We then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types. We focused on two cancer types probably influenced by mechanical stress in vivo: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer. In both, confinement induced significant upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6f-q). Mechanical stress can be associated with nuclear translocation of transcription factors, such as YAP, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition inducers, including Twist, Snail and SMAD3 (Ref: 30). To rule out a potential pro-invasive role for these transcription factors upon mechanical stress in melanoma, we quantified their expression in confined A375 cells. None of the factors examined (YAP, Twist, Snail and SMAD3) exhibited nuclear translocation upon confinement, and the nuclear expression of YAP, Twist and SMAD3 decreased (Extended Data Fig. 7).\n\n> Fig. 3| HMGB2 is a confinement-induced marker of invasion. a, HMG family expression in interface cells from zebrafish melanoma scRNA-seq. b, Normalized hmgb2a/hmgb2b expression.

To confirm that the perinuclear network is upstream of HMGB2 enrichment in the confinement response, we generated stable A375 cell lines in which HMGB2 was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c). Upon confining two different A375-HMGB2KO cell lines, we confirmed that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). We modulated tubulin dynamics and acetylation state in confined cells to determine whether the acetylated tubulin network influences HMGB2 upregulation. Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (Ref: 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (Ref: 32). We first treated A375 cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin (Ref: 33), which increased tubulin acetylation without affecting histone acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 9a-f). In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 \u00b1 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076; Extended Data Fig. 9i). To stabilize MTs independent of acetylation, we treated confined cells with paclitaxel (Taxol), which binds \u03b2-tubulin and prevents tubulin monomer incorporation into MT filaments and thus should not influence the acetylation state of HMGB2 or other proteins (Ref: 34). Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 \u00b1 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects of tubacin on HMGB2, similar results in Taxol-treated and tubacin-treated cells indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions. To confirm the role of perinuclear acetylated tubulin in mediating HMGB2 accumulation, we treated A375[HMGB2-GFP] cells with nocodazole before applying confinement. Nocodazole abolishes most MT networks, with the exception of stabilized acetylated tubulin filaments (Ref: 24). Because the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage was resistant to nocodazole (Fig. 2i,j), nocodazole treatment allowed us to specifically interrogate the contribution of acetylated MTs to HMGB2 upregulation in confined cells. We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j) and HMGB2-GFP accumulation was unaffected (P = 0.714; Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). We quantified HMGB2 accumulation in confined A375-ATAT1KO cells lacking acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). Unexpectedly, HMGB2 accumulation was not impaired in ATAT1KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f), suggesting that acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement. Thus, we investigated other factors that may cooperate with the MT cytoskeleton to promote upregulation of HMGB2 in confined cells using TurboID (Ref: 35) to perform proximity labelling proteomics targeting HMGB2 interactors (Fig. 3l and Supplementary Table 4). One highly enriched protein was nesprin 2 (gene name: SYNE2), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36) (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesized that nesprin 2 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement. Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2. The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36). Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076\u00b2; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\n\n### Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n\nOur results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2. HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37). Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize nuclear HMGB2 dynamics upon confinement. As previously reported (Ref: 38), HMGB2-GFP was highly dynamic even in unconfined cells (Fig. 4a-d), with only approximately 25% stably bound within the nucleus (mobile fraction = 75.21 \u00b1 0.91%). In both conditions, FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two-component exponential equation (average coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) = 0.986 \u00b1 0.00054; Fig. 4d,e and Methods), indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39). Although more than 90% of HMGB2 remained fast-diffusing in both conditions, confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075; Fig. 4f), suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells.\n\n> Fig. 4| Confinement-mediated stabilization of HMGB2 increases chromatin accessibility at neuronal loci. a, Representative stills from time-lapse imaging of A375 cells expressing HMGB2-GFP and subjected to FRAP.

Pvalues are indicated (binomial test).\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci\n\nOur FRAP analysis indicates that confinement upregulates HMGB2 and stabilizes its interactions with chromatin; therefore, we propose that this could affect chromatin accessibility. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g). Peak-gene mapping and pathway analysis revealed that open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes, with increased accessibility at loci linked to the neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h-j and Supplementary Table 5). Homer de novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2OE). The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\u2079), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41). Other highly ranked motifs included PRDM4, which functions in neural development (Ref: 42) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2), and SOX9, a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma (Ref: 43) (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9). These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program. To clarify potential HMGB2 targets, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) targeting HMGB2 in A375 cells using a double-crosslinking approach (Ref: 44) (Extended Data Fig. 11a). We generated a peak atlas by comparing peaks present in cells expressing baseline concentrations of HMGB2 to those not present in HMGB2KO cells, yielding 843 peaks, consistent with previous studies (Ref: 44-46) (Supplementary Table 6). After manual filtering to remove intergenic, low-quality or non-specific peaks, we identified a final high-confidence set of 96 targets (Extended Data Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 6). We observed HMGB2 binding at promoter regions of several AP-1 signalling genes, including FOSL1, JUNB and JUND (Extended Data Fig. 11c and Supplementary Table 6), validating our ATAC-seq results and supporting the pro-invasive role of HMGB2. Several neuronal genes were also identified as HMGB2 targets, including NOTCH2, NOTCH2NLC, TBX6, GBA1 and ZNF335 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6), as well as pro-tumorigenic genes such as KMT2A (Extended Data Fig. 11e and Supplementary Table 6). To examine the transcriptional effects, we performed bulk RNA-seq on A375 cells stably overexpressing HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 11f). HMGB2OE cells adopted a mesenchymal-like and invasive morphology relative to empty vector controls (Extended Data Fig. 11g). The most highly upregulated gene was UNCSD, a netrin receptor promoting neuronal survival and migration (Ref: 47) (Extended Data Fig. 11h and Supplementary Table 7). Other upregulated neuronal genes included DCC, SH3GL2 and NPX2 (Extended Data Fig. 11h, i and Supplementary Table 7). GSEA revealed an overrepresentation of neuronal genes within enriched pathways (Extended Data Fig. 11j,k and Supplementary Table 7). Supporting a pro-invasive role for HMGB2, several invasive genes were also upregulated (MAGEA1, SPP1, CTAG2 and GDF6; Extended Data Fig. 11i and Supplementary Table 7). These data indicate that HMGB2 alters chromatin architecture to promote an invasive neuronal state.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors (MITF) driving proliferation versus invasive factors (BRN2, SOX9 and AP-1) that also slow proliferation. We investigated whether HMGB2 drives invasion through these factors. Using the SKMEL5 melanocytic cell line, we created a stable line expressing V5-tagged HMGB2 and performed ChIP-seq targeting V5 and HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a). We generated a peak atlas containing 1,361 peaks corresponding to 1,286 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 8). We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the MITF promoter (Extended Data Fig. 12c). However, loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log\u2082FC = 0.157; Extended Data Fig. 12e-g and Supplementary Table 9), indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead. HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells. Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells (DLL1, DLL3 and DLK2; Supplementary Table 1) and confined human melanoma cells (NOTCH2NLA, DLK2 and DLL4; Supplementary Table 2). Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50). This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling. Supporting this model, a BRN2/POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Although MITF and BRN2 expressions are often inversely correlated (Ref: 1), previous reports (Ref: 52,53) and our data indicate that these factors can also be co-expressed. Characterizing the mechanisms that control the expression of these factors and the regulation of the proliferative/invasive trade-off will be an important area for future investigation.\n\n### Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching\n\nOne prediction of the melanoma phenotype switching model is the trade-off between opposing phenotypes; highly proliferative cells are less invasive, whereas highly invasive cells are less proliferative (Fig. 5a). Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity. Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b). To visualize the influence of confinement on this trade-off, we generated an A375 cell line stably expressing the FastFUCCI cell cycle sensor (Ref: 54). Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells (mAG\u207a and S/G2-M phase) rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit (Fig. 5c,d). To directly test the role of HMGB2 in melanoma invasion, we used in vitro invasion assays (Fig. 5e) and found that targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion (P = 0.0133; Fig. 5f,g), whereas overexpression of HMGB2 increased invasion (P = 0.0180; Fig. 5h,i). Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55-57). We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 \u00b1 0.0025 \u00b5m min\u207b\u00b9; Extended Data Fig. 13a-c), which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system. To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in vivo, we generated BRAFV600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR. Loss of hmgb2a and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks (P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j-l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m). These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state. HMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail regions (Extended Data Fig. 14a). We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma. We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c). We were unable to express a truncated construct lacking both DNA-binding domains, probably because of its small size (24 amino acids). In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2; this was probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f). Because we were unable to generate constructs lacking both DNA-binding domains, when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j), demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\n\n> Fig. 5| Confinement promotes drug tolerance by downregulating proliferation. a, Schematic detailing the influence of confinement on melanoma phenotype switching. b, Enrichment scores for GO:BP pathways related to cell division from RNA-seq of confined cells relative to unconfined cells.

This has important clinical relevance because drug-tolerant persister cells are major contributors to relapse (Ref: 59). We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response, hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance. To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs. Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60), indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation. We then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in vivo by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib, widely used targeted therapies in melanoma (Ref: 61) (Fig. 5n). HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10). Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15).\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

If it's implicit (i.e., not explicitly stated, but implied?), the instruction says we should mark that component as \"(missing)\". Actually instructions say: \"If ... is not explicitly stated ... mark this component as `(missing)`.\" There's also mention of \"(implicit)\" earlier but later they say mark missing. Actually the instruction says \"*If the component is not found explicitly ... mark that component as `(missing)`.* So we need to use \"(missing)\", not \"(implicit)\". There is some contradictory phrasing: earlier \"If ... is not explicitly stated ... mark as `(missing)`.\" Yes.\n\nThus each triplet must have exact strings for each component, verbatim. For missing components, we put \"(missing)\".\n\nWe need to extract verbatim from the text. Must not paraphrase.\n\nAlso important: The \"Interpretation\" must be first found. Then the premise and connecting principle. However, the order in output is premise, connecting principle, interpretation (like the example). So we must put them accordingly.\n\nWe need to carefully search each subsection.\n\nLet's systematically go through each subsection.\n\n## Subsection: \"Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\"\n\nThe text:\n\n\"To test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS... To perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression... The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA... All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by H3K27ac... To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq multiome profiling... We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (411 kb away)... We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos... This analysis confirmed the above E-P links... We next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig. 1d ...) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology... All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype... These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable...\"\n\nInterpretation candidate: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\"\n\nThus Interpretation: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\"\n\nPremise: It's the specific results that support this conclusion: \"replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud\" and \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype... indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence...\"\n\nThus premise can be the sentence: \"replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).\" Or also \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype... identical to the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence\". Both are part of premise.\n\nWe need to pick the one that directly leads to interpretation. That is the loss of Shh expression and truncated limb phenotype. In the text, \"Notably, replacing ... resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression... All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype ... These results indicate...\" So the premise is the two empirical observations. Perhaps we can combine both in one premise statement? The requirement is a verbatim extraction; can we combine two sentences? The example didn't combine but seemed to treat entire paragraph as premise? Could be a long excerpt. The premise can be a single sentence, but we could also combine multiple sentences but within quotes as they appear. We might need to pick the clause that directly mentions the observation: \"replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).\" That is a direct observation. Then \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype... indistinguishable from ...\". That is another observation but could be merged.\n\nInterpretation can be the aforementioned.\n\nConnecting principle: What prior knowledge is used to interpret this? The text preceding the interpretation includes earlier statements like \"Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances (Ref: 1,2,8-10). Disruption leads to disease. ... Higher-order 3D chromatin organization...\" but those are not in this subsection. The current subsection's interpretation might rely on known notion that enhancer distance matters, but that is not explicitly cited in this part. However earlier in the subsection, they mention \"limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).\" That is prior knowledge: the distance of ZRS. Also perhaps \"The ZRS enhancer controls limb expression of Shh across long distance, and is essential.\" This could be the connecting principle. The sentence: \"Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).\" This is a prior known fact that ZRS functions at long distance. It provides context: the observation that other enhancers do not support such long-range activation indicates that only ZRS does. So the connecting principle could be the statement about ZRS being at 848 kb but controlling Shh, referencing that prior work (citation). So we can extract that sentence as connecting principle.\n\nThus, for this subsection we have at least one triplet.\n\nPotentially there may be another interpretation somewhere else in the subsection: maybe earlier \"To test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed series...\" but that is not an interpretation, it's background. The main interpretation is the concluding statement.\n\nThus we need to output one triplet for this subsection.\n\nNow let's extract exact verbatim.\n\nPremise: \"replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).\" Actually the sentence starts with \"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).\" So we need the exact text including \"Notably,\".\n\nThus premise_finding: \"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).\"\n\nPotentially also include the second observation: \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\" That could be separate premise, but if we include both in same premise, we might combine with \"and\". However to be safe, we could capture only the first one. But interpretation mentions both lack of Shh expression and inability to support limb development. So the premise may need both. The text \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype... indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence\". That can be a second premise or part of same. Since it's a distinct observation, we could consider the premise includes both lines: \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype...\". However the instruction: \"Premise (The 'What We Found')... direct statements of results ('We found that...') often linked to figures.\" Could combine multiple sentences, but it's okay.\n\nWe might combine both into one premise: \"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\"\n\nBut the instruction wants verbatim extraction. Combining them must be exactly as they appear. Let's extract both sentences separately? The JSON format expects a single string for premise_finding. We could simply include the first sentence as premise_finding, and the second piece could be considered part of connecting principle? No, the second is also a result.\n\nGiven there may be multiple interpretations or multiple premises for a single interpretation, but we need to capture one premise that is sufficient. The central result is that replacement leads to loss of Shh expression and truncated limbs. The first sentence says loss of Shh expression, second sentence says truncated limbs. The interpretation says they lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development (\"limb development\" is the whole phenotype). So both are needed. We could combine them into one premise string that includes both sentences separated by a space. The exact string would be: \"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\"\n\nBut is that an exact verbatim representation? Yes, those two sentences appear consecutively, separated by a period. The exact phrasing for second: \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\" The text includes \"All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.\" Yes. So we can combine exactly.\n\nNow connecting principle: The prior knowledge that \"Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS... located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).\" This prior knowledge explains the significance: normally ZRS works at long distance; these enhancers cannot.\n\nThus connecting_principle: \"Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).\"\n\nInterpretation: \"These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\"\n\nThus one triplet.\n\nNow we need to go through each subsection similarly.\n\n## Subsection: \"Transplanted enhancers are accessible\"\n\nText:\n\n\"It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-distance enhancers(Ref: 34,35). To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC-seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 KI alleles. HS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC-seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.\"\n\nPremise: \"Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a).\" Also perhaps earlier mention \"ZRIHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs.\" But the conclusion about accessibility is based on ATAC-seq data. So premise could be that sentence.\n\nConnecting principle: The background knowledge that \"silencing of the inserted region or failure ... explains.. possibility\" is not exactly connecting principle; maybe the overall principle is that \"open chromatin architecture is required for enhancer activity.\" But is that explicitly stated? Not exactly. They do not explicitly cite a prior paper for that claim. They earlier said \"It is possible that silencing of the inserted region... explains inability...\" but that's speculation, not a known principle. However they refer to references (Ref: 34,35) for that speculation which is prior knowledge. So connecting principle could be \"It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-distance enhancers(Ref: 34,35).\" That is a prior knowledge referencing other papers about importance of open chromatin for enhancer function.\n\nThus connecting_principle: \"It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-distance enhancers(Ref: 34,35).\" However that is more a hypothesis than a known fact. But it's citing prior references, thus considered prior knowledge.\n\nThus triplet.\n\n## Subsection: \"The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\"\n\nText:\n\n\"The inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising... To test whether E-P incompatibility could have a role... we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct... All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter(Ref: 38-40). To test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41). As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity(Ref: 42) (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72::Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Importantly, ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.\"\n\nPremise: The observations: \"All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds\" and \"ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds\". Also \"ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs\". The key premise is that \"All transgenic mouse embryos... displayed strong LacZ expression ... indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter\" and also the KI mice with HS72 inserted near promoter leads to polydactyly and Shh expression.\n\nThus we could choose the first direct observation: \"All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b).\" That is premise.\n\nAlternatively could be the KI observation: \"ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity\". That also supports conclusion. We might combine both? Probably one is sufficient. We'll include both maybe as one premise statement combined: \"All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds... ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds...\" but these are two sentences; we can combine them.\n\nConnecting principle: Prior knowledge? The statement about \"preaxial polydactyly provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA\" is prior knowledge cited (Ref: 2,41). Also the notion that \"HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme\" is known? That's based on prior data. But the connecting principle could be \"Preaxial polydactyly ... provides a sensitive ... phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb (Ref: 2,41).\" That is used to interpret that polydactyly indicates enhancer activation. However the interpretation is that the enhancer can activate promoter at short range; connecting principle may not be required. However we need to find prior knowledge used to interpret: Possibly \"The HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter\" which is also prior knowledge? That is not citation; they show evidence.\n\nAlternatively, the connecting principle could be \"E-P incompatibility could have a role... we placed HS72 upstream of Shh promoter... All transgenic embryos displayed...\"\n\nBut that is part of the experiment, not a known principle. Perhaps the connecting principle is \"Preaxial polydactyly provides a sensitive ... phenotypic readout (Ref: 2,41).\" This is prior knowledge used to infer that the observed polydactyly indicates activation.\n\nThus connecting principle: \"Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41).\"\n\nInterpretation we identified.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n## Subsection: \"REX is required for long-range activation\"\n\nText:\n\n\"The HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter and is accessible when transplanted ... suggesting that its failure to activate Shh remotely could be due to the extreme distance ... We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. ... We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer... This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays... we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig. 3b). Consistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly... Notably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.\"\n\nPremise: \"addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth... ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly ... and ... the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression...\"\n\nThus premise could be \"addition of this uncharacterized sequence... to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth... ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly...\" plus \"the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer... unable to drive LacZ reporter expression.\" Might combine into one premise string.\n\nConnecting principle: Prior knowledge? The text earlier mentions \"enhancers often regulate target promoters across long distances... but how remote enhancers precisely relay...\" The specific connecting principle might be that \"enhancers can act at long distances, but additional sequences may be required.\" That is more a hypothesis, not a citation. However earlier they hypothesized that additional functional sequences may be required. They cite no references. Possibly the connecting principle is \"The HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter and is accessible when transplanted (Fig. 2) suggesting its failure... could be due to distance.\" That's not prior known fact but derived from earlier data.\n\nAlternatively we might find a connecting principle earlier: \"Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances (Ref: 1,2,8-10).\" This appears earlier in the introduction and not repeated here. But does the text in this subsection explicitly mention the principle? It says: \"The HS72 enhancer ... suggests its failure ... could be due to the extreme distance from the Shh promoter.\" That's more speculation. Not a known principle. However they may refer to \"we hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers.\" That's hypothesis.\n\nThus there may be no explicit connecting principle. The instruction says if not explicit, mark as \"(missing)\". So we will set connecting_principle to \"(missing)\". Because no explicit prior knowledge with citation is mentioned here. The phrase \"we hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation\" is a hypothesis, not prior known fact. Might be considered connecting principle? It is somewhat building a rationale: that there may be additional sequences. But it's an internal hypothesis, not prior knowledge. The definition says \"Connecting Principle is a statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge... Provide the established biological context or mechanism needed to understand the significance of the Premise.\" It could be a hypothesis, but must be prior knowledge? The phrase \"previously identified the ... block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer\" is descriptive, not a known principle. The earlier sentences include \"We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation.\" That is not pre-existing knowledge, it's speculation. So we likely set it missing.\n\nThus one triplet for this subsection.\n\n## Subsection: \"REX is sufficient for long-range activation\"\n\nText:\n\n\"To test whether the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers, we generated a KI mouse line in which the ZRS was replaced with a chimeric element consisting of the shortest-range heterologous limb enhancer from our test set (MM1492, 73 kb native E-P range) appended by the REX element (MM1492 + REX; Extended Data Fig. 5d). KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e). These mice also displayed polydactyly, consistent with broad limb activity of MM1492. Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation. These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation.\"\n\nPremise: \"KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e).\" Also \"These mice also displayed polydactyly...\"\n\nSo premise can be that sentence.\n\nConnecting principle: Possibly prior knowledge that \"short-range enhancers generally cannot act at long range.\" That is established earlier, but maybe not explicit here. However the text may refer to prior work: not obviously cited. The phrase \"short-range enhancer ... normally cannot act at long range\" might be known knowledge from previous experiments (the earlier subsection). However they do not explicitly state such knowledge here with a citation. So connecting principle might be missing. The text says \"These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner ...\" That's not prior knowledge. So we set connecting principle as \"(missing)\".\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n## Subsection: \"LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\"\n\nText:\n\n\"To identify specific TFs that may be involved in REX-mediated long-range enhancer action, we examined potential TF-binding sites within the REX element. The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig. 6j). We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). To determine the importance of LHX and LEF1 motifs for REX function, we generated two KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with the extended HS72 sequence containing the REX element with either the single LEF1 motif or both LHX motifs mutagenized. Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly indicating that disruption of the LEF1 motif does not abolish long-range activity of the REX element (Fig. 4b). However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus.\"\n\nPremise: The two observations: \"Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly...\" and \"However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c)\". The key premise is the effect of LHX motif mutation leading to loss of activity. So premise could be \"disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud\". This is the crucial experimental result.\n\nConnecting principle: Prior knowledge about LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain TFs binding motifs? The text mentions that the motifs match binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain TFs. That is prior knowledge about transcription factor motifs. However is there a citation? The motif identification is implicit perhaps from databases, but not cited. However the statement \"identified conserved motifs ... matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1\" is a known fact about those motifs, not necessarily a cited reference. But it is a knowledge claim about TF binding preferences, which is prior knowledge. It doesn't have a reference. The instruction: connecting principle must be a statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as logical bridge, often with citations. The phrase \"identified conserved motifs ... matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs\" is knowledge about motif binding; that is pre-existing knowledge. However it's not cited, though the knowledge may be from known motif databases. Since it's a statement, we can consider it as connecting principle. However it's also part of earlier step to identify motifs, not necessarily linking premise to interpretation. The connecting principle used to interpret that LHX motifs are necessary is the prior understanding that LHX motifs are binding sites for LHX TFs that might mediate enhancer activity. The sentence \"identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1\" is about motif identification, not a biological principle about function. But we might treat it as linking premise to conclusion. However the interpretation is that LHX motifs are required to facilitate long-range enhancer activity. The connecting principle would be the known fact that LHX2/9 are homeodomain TFs that can mediate enhancer function. But a direct sentence might be missing. Another possible connecting principle is that \"The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig. 6j).\" That's a statement about known factors not present. But that doesn't directly support interpretation.\n\nThus likely the explicit connecting principle is missing. There's no explicit citation of LHX TFs function in long-range interactions. So we set connecting principle to \"(missing)\". However we might use \"identified conserved motifs ... matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs\" as connecting principle. That is a knowledge statement that these motifs correspond to LHX TF binding preferences. It's explicit, though no citation. But it's a known motif annotation; maybe it's considered prior knowledge.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"Connect Principle is a statement of pre-existing knowledge ... may include citations.\" So if it's based on known motif databases, it's prior knowledge. Since it's present in the text, we can use that. Let's do that.\n\nThus connecting_principle: \"We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a).\"\n\nPremise: \"disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b).\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus.\"\n\nThus triplet.\n\n## Subsection: \"LHX motifs are critical for ZRS activity\"\n\nText:\n\n\"We next examined whether [C/T]AATTA motifs located inside enhancers are specifically required for their long-range enhancer activity. The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig. 5a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse(Ref: 44). We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRSAHD), drives eGFP. ... We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). ... Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP, indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation (P < 0.0182; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Having established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E-P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRSAHD/AHD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSAHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity. These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances. Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T] AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\"\n\nInterpretation: Several possible statements. The final sentences: \"Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity.\" Also \"Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T] AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\"\n\nWe need to pick the explicit interpretation(s). Possibly two.\n\nInterpretation 1: \"[C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity.\"\n\nInterpretation 2: \"the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T] AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\"\n\nWe could produce two triplets.\n\nNow find premise(s) for each.\n\nTriplet 1 (short-range vs long-range requirement):\n\nPremise: The results that the mutated ZRS lacking motifs can still drive reporter expression in ZPA (short range) but KI mice with mutated motifs lost limb outgrowth (long range). So premise is \"The ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c...)\" plus \"disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb\" (Fig.5d). Could combine.\n\nThus premise_finding: \"The ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). ... disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d).\" Combine into one string as above.\n\nConnecting principle: Perhaps prior knowledge about [C/T]AATTA motifs being core binding motifs for homeodomain TFs, known from other contexts. But we have a sentence earlier: \"The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs\" - that's just stating presence. The connecting principle could be \"These motifs are known homeodomain binding sites.\" There is no explicit statement of that here, but earlier they identified motifs' significance. However later they discuss that \"These motifs are critical for long-range activity.\" The connecting principle may be missing. However there is an implicit background that enhancer motifs mediate transcription factor binding. However no explicit statement.\n\nBut earlier in the same subsection they say: \"We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRSAHD), drives eGFP.\" That is just experiment.\n\nThus connecting principle: Could be \"The [C/T]AATTA motifs are known to be homeodomain binding sites.\" However not provided explicitly here. Let's see earlier maybe they mention: \"The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates.\" That is description but not known function. They state that they are uncharacterized. So that does not provide known functional principle.\n\nThus likely connecting principle is missing.\n\nThus have (missing).\n\nInterpretation 2: \"the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T] AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\"\n\nPremise: The rescue experiment: \"The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRSAHD/AHD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSAHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e).\"\n\nThus premise_finding: \"The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRSAHD/AHD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSAHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e).\"\n\nConnecting principle: The prior knowledge that \"REX element contains [C/T]AATTA motifs that mediate long-range enhancer activity\" as identified earlier. Indeed earlier they have: \"The REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long-range enhancer activity (Fig. 4a,c).\" That is a statement connecting the motif to function. So we can use that as connecting principle. However that statement is in a different subsection, but it's part of the current text? The \"LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\" subsection includes: \"The REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long-range enhancer activity.\" This appears as a statement of prior knowledge linking motif to function. But is it pre-existing knowledge? It was discovered in this study, but it's a result of the current study, not prior external citation. So not valid as connecting principle. However the connecting principle could be the known principle that adding an element that provides [C/T]AATTA motifs can restore long-range activity (from previous results). But that's also from same study.\n\nWe need a connecting principle that is prior knowledge outside current results. Possibly they refer to the general principle that \"addition of the REX element can rescue long-range activity\" as known from prior experiments described earlier in the paper (themselves). But might be considered established within this paper, but not necessarily prior external knowledge. The instruction says \"pre-existing knowledge\" but could be prior parts of the current paper? Possibly yes, \"pre-existing knowledge\" could include previously established findings within the paper. However the connecting principle is supposed to provide context for the interpretation. So we could use a statement from earlier results that \"the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers\" \u2014 this is from earlier subsection. That is a knowledge within the same paper; it is previously shown. That qualifies.\n\nThus we could use: \"These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.\" (From \"REX is sufficient for long-range activation\" subsection). Or \"addition of the REX element to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth.\" That is prior knowledge in the paper. That might be acceptable as connecting principle. The statement \"addition of the REX element to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth\" is a result, but it's from previous subsection, now being used to interpret the rescue.\n\nThus we need to extract the connecting principle from the paper. Let's identify a sentence: \"addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod\". That is pre-existing knowledge within the paper.\n\nThus connecting_principle: \"addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a).\"\n\nWe can use that.\n\nThus second triplet for this subsection.\n\nNow we have identified triplets for each subsection.\n\nNow we need to create JSON array.\n\nWe'll have seven objects, each with \"subsection\": the header names exactly as given. Ensure consistent naming.\n\nThe headers are exactly:\n\n- \"Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\"\n- \"Transplanted enhancers are accessible\"\n- \"The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\"\n- \"REX is required for long-range activation\"\n- \"REX is sufficient for long-range activation\"\n- \"LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\"\n- \"LHX motifs are critical for ZRS activity\"\n\nNow compile triplets per each.\n\n### Subsection 1: Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\n\nTriplet:\n\npremise_finding: \"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).

The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh(Ref: 2). The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis-acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals(Ref: 3-7). Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances (Ref: 1,2,8-10). Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer(Ref: 8,11-14). A central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood (Ref: 1,15). Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs)(Ref: 16-20). However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF-and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression (Ref: 21-25). Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs(Ref: 26-31). Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood(Ref: 1,13,15,32). Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation. Here we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively abolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\n\nTo test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2). Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb(Ref: 33). Owing to the clear phenotypic readout and lack of redundancy, ZRS-Shh is an ideal locus for assessing the long-range enhancer activity of transplanted enhancers. To perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression in the developing limb bud mesenchyme (MM1492 and MM1564 (from mouse) and HS1516 and HS72 (from human); Fig. 1a,b). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA, a posterior domain of the limb mesenchyme where ZRS activates Shh gene expression (Fig. 1b). All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by acetylation at lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27ac) in limb buds, a histone modification that is associated with active enhancers (Fig. 1a). To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) multiome profiling of 14,000 cells from a wild-type (WT) embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) hindlimb bud (Methods). After clustering all 14,000 cells on the basis of their chromatin and gene expression profiles, we annotated 16 clusters representing all major cell types in the developing limb bud (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers display strong DNA accessibility in Shh positive ZPA cells, consistent with their ability to drive robust reporter expression in posterior limb mesenchyme in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 1a). To link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, we used the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from multiome profiling and E-P physical interaction data based on tissue-resolved high-resolution enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Methods). We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (mouse homologue of HS1516) (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (mouse homologue of HS72) (411 kb away) (Fig. 1c). We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos. This analysis confirmed the above E-P links and additionally identified Rbms1 as a putative target for MM1564 (177 kb away; Fig. 1b,c). We next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology in E18.5 KI mice. Consistent with the loss of limb-specific Shh expression, all four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. The limb phenotypes were indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence of similar length (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Transplanted enhancers lack long-range limb activity in KI mice. a, For each limb enhancer (coloured blocks), pseudobulk ZPA scATAC-seq, E11.5 forelimb H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)(Ref: 69) and placental conservation tracks are shown. mHS72 and mHS1516 are the mouse homologues of the HS72 and HS1516 enhancers. b, The corresponding enhancer activities in transgenic E11.5 mouse embryos.

To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC-seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 KI alleles. HS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC-seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.\n\n### Subsection: The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\n\nThe inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising, given their robust enhancer features and ability to establish open chromatin at the transplanted location. Previously, all four limb enhancers were characterized in transgenic mice using a well-established hsp68 minimal promoter, but their compatibility with the Shh promoter is unclear. To test whether E-P incompatibility(Ref: 36,37) could have a role in the observed differences in gene activation, we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct into fertilized mouse eggs. All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZexpression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter(Ref: 38-40). To test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41). As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity(Ref: 42) (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72::Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Importantly, ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Transplanted enhancers maintain open chromatin structure and drive functional Shh expression in the limb at short range. a, Allele-specific ZPA ATAC-seq profiles at the transplanted HS1516 (green box) and HS72 (orange box) enhancers and the corresponding WT ZRS locus (top).

Scale bars, 1 mm (b (left) and c) and 250 \u00b5m (b, right).\n\n### Subsection: REX is required for long-range activation\n\nThe HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter and is accessible when transplanted in place of the ZRS (Fig. 2) suggesting that its failure to activate Shh remotely could be due to the extreme distance from the Shh promoter. Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig. 1c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig. 1c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig. 3a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs. 1b and 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig. 3b). Consistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs. 1b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a-c). Notably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.\n\n### Subsection: REX is sufficient for long-range activation\n\nTo test whether the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers, we generated a KI mouse line in which the ZRS was replaced with a chimeric element consisting of the shortest-range heterologous limb enhancer from our test set (MM1492, 73 kb native E-P range) appended by the REX element (MM1492 + REX; Extended Data Fig. 5d). KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e). These mice also displayed polydactyly, consistent with broad limb activity of MM1492. Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation. These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.\n\n> Fig. 3 | The REX element is necessary and sufficient for long-range activation of Shh by a heterologous limb enhancer. a, An evolutionary conserved element of unknown function is located adjacent to the human HS72 enhancer. The HS72 enhancer region is shown together with evolutionary conservation tracks. b, Replacement of the ZRS with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer (chromosome 16: 51623658-51625572; hg38) containing the REX element results in initiation of Shh expression in developing limb buds and full limb outgrowth in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX KI mice.

The stars indicate extra digits (polydactyly). Hindlimb Shh expression analysis is provided in Extended Data Fig. 5. Scale bars, 1 mm (c (left) and b and d (right)), 500 \u00b5m (b and d, middle) and 250 \u00b5m (c, right).\n\n### Subsection: LHX motifs are critical for REX activity\n\nTo identify specific TFs that may be involved in REX-mediated long-range enhancer action, we examined potential TF-binding sites within the REX element. The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig. 6j). We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a). To determine the importance of LHX and LEF1 motifs for REX function, we generated two KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with the extended HS72 sequence containing the REX element with either the single LEF1 motif or both LHX motifs mutagenized. Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly indicating that disruption of the LEF1 motif does not abolish long-range activity of the REX element (Fig. 4b). However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus. To investigate whether the LHX or other TF motifs are present at long-range limb enhancers, we used a collection of experimentally validated limb enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a unique resource of human and mouse enhancers with in vivo activities characterized in transgenic mice(Ref: 43). We linked these bona fide limb enhancers to their putative target genes using the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from our single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq experiment or E-P physical interactions from enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1d). We next performed motif analysis of these limb enhancers. We found 33 motifs that match the binding preferences of limb-expressed TFs that are significantly enriched in long-range acting (173 regions; E-P distance, 400 kb to 2 Mb) compared to short-range acting (28 regions; E-P distance, 10-200 kb) enhancer regions (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P<1\u00d710-2 and target frequency > 30%), with LHX2 and LHX9 being among the most significantly enriched (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, HD TFs with a similar [C/T]AATTA consensus binding preference, including DLX5, MSX2 and SHOX2, comprised 10 out of these 33 motifs. By contrast, short-range limb enhancers showed no enrichment for TF motifs over long-range enhancers. We next examined all 19,276 limb mesenchyme E-P pairs predicted from our scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq experiment (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 2). Genome wide, the LHX2 motif was among the most significantly enriched in long-range versus short-range limb enhancers (CT\u0410\u0410\u0422\u0422\u0410, P < 6 \u00d7 10-32). Overall, [C/T]AATTA HD motifs, including both LHX2 and LHX9 motifs, comprised 15 out of the top 20 most significantly enriched motifs in long-range limb enhancers. The REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long range enhancer activity (Fig. 4a,c). To test whether having more than one [C/T] AATTA motif could be characteristic of other long-range enhancers, we examined the number of [C/T]AATTA motifs in experimentally validated and multiome-predicted limb enhancers (Methods). Indeed, for limb enhancers containing more than one [C/T]AATTA motif the enhancer regions were on average 429 kb farther (median distance) from their target promoters than other limb enhancers (P<0.01; Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6f-i). Taken together, these results indicate that conserved [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are enriched in long-distance limb enhancers throughout the genome and are frequently located within the conserved core of enhancers themselves (Extended Data Fig. 6k).\n\n> Fig. 4 | The REX element contains conserved LHX motifs that are critical for its function and globally linked to long-range regulation. a, The position and evolutionary conservation of predicted TF motifs within the REX element.

The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T] AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig. 5a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse(Ref: 44). We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRSAHD), drives eGFP. The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig. 5a). We injected the resulting ZRS-mCherry/ZRSAHD-eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). We obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig. 5c). While both the ZRS and ZRSAHD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRSAHD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity(Ref: 45). Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP, indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation (P < 0.0182; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b). Having established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E-P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRSAHD/AHD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSAHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity. These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances. Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T] AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T]AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.\n\n> Fig. 5 | [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are required for long-range gene activation. a, The position of previously identified TF-binding sites within the mouse ZRS core (chromosome 5: 29314881-29315667; mm10)(Ref: 45,70).

{"request_id": 3, "reasoning": "We need to parse the provided excerpt, focusing on the Results section. The Results section has several subsections: \"Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\", \"Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\", \"Subsection: NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME\", \"Subsection: Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\", \"Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\", \"Subsection: NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis\", \"Subsection: Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy\". Each subsection contains multiple paragraphs.\n\nWe need to find three-part logical arguments: Premise (empirical result from the current study), Connecting Principle (pre-existing knowledge from literature), and Interpretation (the conclusion/hypothesis). The interpretation must be identified first. Then locate the premise and connecting principle that led to it.\n\nWe must produce a JSON array with objects for each subsection, with \"subsection\" = header name (as appears). For each subsection, we list triplets (each a logical argument). If no arguments found, triplets empty.\n\nThe excerpts have many statements that combine the three parts. However, we need to be careful: The interpretation statements are sentences like \"These results collectively suggested that...\", \"These results collectively suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\" Or \"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\" That is an interpretation.\n\nWe must for each interpretation find the premise and connecting principle.\n\nWe must also note implicit or missing components; we should mark missing if not present explicitly. Typically, the connecting principles are given as statements referencing literature, e.g., \"NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33).\" That is the bridging knowledge. The premise might be \"We observed increased NRF2 activation and HO-1 in TREM2hi mo-macs compared with CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in KP tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3h)...\" This can be a premise.\n\nBut must follow order: find the interpretation first. Then locate premise and connecting principle. So we need to parse each paragraph.\n\nLet's go subsection by subsection.\n\n## Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nParagraph(s) summarizing findings: They observed increased LT-HSC, CMP, GMP, cMoP; increased colonies; increased ROS etc. Then at the end they say \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\"\n\nPremise: Observations of increased progenitors, increased ROS, etc. But we need to locate specific statements as premise. For example: \"We observed a marked increase in LT-HSC, CMP, GMP and cMoP... (Fig. 1a)\" and \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\" Those are premises.\n\nConnecting principle: What background knowledge is introduced? The paragraph includes references to other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis supportive of oxidative stress: \"which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13)\". Also mentions \"Tumour-driven myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20)\". The connecting principle might be known that oxidative stress response is involved in myelopoiesis.\n\nBut the line: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\" That includes literature references as connecting principle. The interpretation is earlier? The \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways...\" That sentence appears as an interpretation. It says \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives...\". So that is the interpretation. Then the premise is the data preceding: \"Differentially upregulated genes...\" and \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores... while exhibiting increased ROS burden...\" The connecting principle is the literature about \"ROS stress response\" and \"IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion\". The paragraph also includes \"In line with our transcriptional results... TF motifs enriched.\" The connecting principle perhaps includes \"Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions...\". That is about known TF motifs, but it's also data.\n\nWe must differentiate between premise (empirical) and connecting principle (knowledge from other sources). The referenced literature statements are connecting principles. For example, \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response ... supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13)\". That is a connecting principle: other works have shown similar oxidative stress gene programs in tumour-driven myelopoiesis. So that can be used.\n\nThus we can extract at least one logical triplet for this subsection.\n\nPotential triplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response, mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion.\"\n\nPremise: \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"These observations were supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).\"\n\nBut we also need to include references to literature that give background on ROS stress and IFN hypo responsiveness. The connecting principle could be \"Oxidative stress response pathways are known to be involved in myelopoiesis (Ref: 20)\", \"IFN hypo-responsiveness limits exhaustion (Ref: 22)\". Those statements appear as citations.\n\nThus the connecting principle might be the citation statements that reference known mechanisms: \"tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\"\n\nBut those appear right after the interpretation in the same sentence. Actually the sentence: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\" In that case the connecting principle is integrated into the interpretation. However the interpretation is the claim about priming, while the references provide literature support for each component. That is fine if we treat the part with citations as connecting principle.\n\nBut we need a distinct connecting principle phrase. The preceding text may have a statement about IFN hypo-responsiveness: \"The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs... further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity.\" That's not literature, but it's data. So I think we can find a more explicit literature-based statement. The paragraph earlier includes \"Oxidative stress response pathways (Ref: 20)\" are known to be involved. There is a citation \"Oxidative stress response (Ref: 20)\" which is referencing other work. That can be used as connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet 1.\n\nPotential a second triplet in same subsection: Perhaps the statement about \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors had increased TF motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs...\" could lead to interpretation: \"Thus, tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways involved in ROS stress response.\" But it's overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, there may be an interpretation: \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\" That is final sentence \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\"\n\nPremise: \"We observed a marked increase in LT-HSC, CMP, GMP and cMoP... (Fig. 1a), along with increased ROS burden and oxidative stress signatures (Fig. 1c,d) in tumour-burdened mice and similar expansions in NSCLC patients.\" (there's also \"We quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC...\").\n\nConnecting principle: \"Cancer-associated inflammation is known to drive myelopoiesis and oxidative stress responses (Refs: 12,13).\" But that is in the same paragraph.\n\nThus we can extract at least one or two triplets.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Scan the Results section carefully\". So we need to identify all logical arguments across subsections. That could be a lot. Let's find each interpretation statement.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\n\nInterpretations are:\n\n- \"These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\"\n\nActually the text: \"These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\" There's a phrase: \"These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\" That's interpretation.\n\nPremise: \"We adoptively transferred GMPs from either tumour-bearing mice or naive mice into a tumour-bearing congenic host... we found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory... increased GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs...\" etc. Also \"We differentiated BMDM ex vivo in the presence of tumour conditioning early or later... early exposure enhanced mo-mac suppressive phenotype.\" So premise is those experiments.\n\nConnecting principle: There is a known background: \"Monocyte-derived macrophages often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1)\" and \"tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2).\" Those are literature statements that contextualize why the finding matters. So those can be connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nInterpretation: Also \"These results collectively suggest that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\" That appears later: \"In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\"\n\nPremise: \"We observed that Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS (Extended Data Fig. 3g).\" Also \"TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs.\" So premise is that.\n\nConnecting principle: The known mechanism: \"Oxidative stress responses are known to drive cytoprotective chromatin changes (Ref: ...?). Also \"NRF2 pathway activation leads to cytoprotective gene expression\" is known. Possibly referenced earlier: \"NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes...\" That's later. But here we might use general knowledge: \"Oxidative stress response pathways are known to activate cytoprotective programs (Ref: 20)\". That is a connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: \"These results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\"\n\nAlso later: \"Thus, exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\" This appears later after the NRF2 focused sections? Actually it's in \"NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME\" subsection: \"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\"\n\nInterpretation: That is the direct conclusion.\n\nPremise: \"We observed that tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility, but not activation of downstream gene programs. Also we observed that tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments had lower GFP expression (Mx1), indicating lower IFN responsiveness. There was stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated tumor and waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation.\" So premise includes that.\n\nConnecting principle: Known knowledge: \"NRF2 can suppress type I IFN pathway genes and limit inflammasome activation\" (Ref: 30-33). Also \"NRF2 is known to oppose NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory cascades (Ref: 28,29).\" So that is connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nNow let's parse each subsection for such logical arguments.\n\n### Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\" (explicit)\n\n- \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with an oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\" (final sentence)\n\nThus we can extract at least two triplets.\n\nPremise for first interpretation: The many data about increased oxidative stress signatures and ROS, as earlier described. There is a specific sentence indicating \"Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as \u2018response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2019, \u2018hypoxia response\u2019, \u2018regulation of apoptosis\u2019 and \u2018metabolic regulation of superoxide generation\u2019...\". (Premise). Also \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden...\". (Premise). So we can take one of those.\n\nConnecting principle: The citations (Ref: 20,21,22) that describe the known involvement of ROS stress, mitochondria-ER adaptation, and IFN hypo-responsiveness.\n\nInterpretation: The sentence above.\n\nSecond interpretation: \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\"\n\nPremise: The observations of increased HSCs, CMP, GMP, cMoP in BM; increased mobilization of monocytes and neutrophils in blood; increased oxidative stress signatures; also in NSCLC patients \"HSCs, MPPs and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC\".\n\nConnecting principle: Perhaps prior knowledge that inflammation leads to myelopoiesis; \"Tumour-driven myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8)\" is earlier in Introduction. But within Results we may have reference: \"These observations were supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).\" That could serve as connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: The sentence.\n\nThus two triplets.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\" (from early paragraph).\n\n- \"These results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\" (later)\n\n- Also \"Thus, exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci... which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\" This appears later, but it's in NRF2 section.\n\nBut within this subsection, we have:\n\nFirst paragraph: after adoptive transfer experiment: \"We found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory... These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\"\n\nInterpretation: That sentence.\n\nPremise: Adoptive transfer data: \"We adoptively transferred GMPs... found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory... increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs... increased PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs, decreased CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs...\"\n\nConnecting principle: Background that \"Monocyte-derived macrophages ... often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1) and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2).\" Those are from the Introduction but they may be repeated in the Results? Not necessarily. But they exist earlier as a known fact. In the results text, they might not be directly repeated. However we must search for a connecting principle within this subsection.\n\nLater in the same subsection, they mention TFs for oxidative stress response are enriched in tumour-dominant mo-macs. But the connecting principle might be knowledge that oxidative stress response TFs, like NRF2, are known to regulate cytoprotective programs. But that is more later.\n\nNevertheless, we can still identify connecting principle: \"TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs.\" That's not a literature statement but observation. However we need a pre-existing knowledge statement.\n\nMaybe look at later passage: \"These results suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci ...\".\n\nBut that refers to next subsection likely.\n\nThus for first interpretation we might need to consider that connecting principle may be missing (implicit). The instruction says if missing, mark as `(missing)`. So we can mark connecting principle as `(missing)`.\n\nSecond interpretation in this subsection: \"These results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\"\n\nInterpretation: that sentence.\n\nPremise: Data: \"TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs.\" Also \"Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS (Extended Data Fig. 3g).\"\n\nConnecting principle: Known that oxidative stress induces cytoprotective chromatin changes: \"Oxidative stress response pathways are known to alter chromatin and activate cytoprotective programs (Ref: 20)\". That may be mentioned elsewhere, but we can likely refer to \"Oxidative stress response pathways (Ref: 20)\". Possibly the sentence: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20)\". That indicates connecting principle. However referencing the same reference is not explicitly linking to these changes in mo-macs. Might be considered connecting principle.\n\nAlternatively, explicit literature statement: \"NRF2 is known to activate antioxidant gene batteries, promoting resistance to lipid-associated ferroptosis and opposing NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory cascades (Ref: 28,29).\" That's from the next subsection. But if we stick to this subsection, perhaps we can treat that as connecting principle. However, the connection is being made about oxidative stress response and cytoprotective chromatin changes, which is known from literature. The reference may be present earlier, e.g., \"Oxidative stress response pathways, like NRF2, are known to drive cytoprotective chromatin modifications (Ref: 20)\". Let's search: In the paragraph about BM myeloid progenitors: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20)\". That is indeed connecting principle: referenced literature linking ROS stress response to priming. So we can adopt that.\n\nThus triplet.\n\n### Subsection: NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME\n\nInterpretation statements:\n- \"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\" (from the \"NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response\" subsection). Actually it appears after the discussion of IFN responsiveness: \"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci ...\". Yes.\n\n- Also earlier: \"Thus, tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness.\" That's a finding, but not a conclusion. The interpretation might be further: \"Thus, the stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrate the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation.\" That's observation.\n\n- Also \"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci...\".\n\nInterpretation: The above sentence.\n\nPremise: Data: \"We implanted lung tumours in Mx1GFP IFN-sensitive reporter mice... tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression... there was a stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation.\" Also \"We observed tumor-educated BM GMPs and monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility but not activation of downstream gene programs.\" Also \"Reduced IFN-stimulated response in tumor-experienced BM myeloid cells.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"NRF2 can directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33).\" Also \"NRF2 opposes NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory cascade (Ref: 28,29)\" and \"NRF2 is a regulator of oxidative stress response\". These statements establish known link between NRF2 and IFN suppression.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAlso there may be a separate interpretation: \"These results suggest that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\" This is same.\n\nThus only one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"Thus, our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand (Extended Data Fig. 6q).\" Actually at end: \"Our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand.\"\n\nInterpretation: That sentence.\n\nPremise: Data: \"Protein factors are the dominant trigger in tumour CM... GM-CSF and IL-6 were enriched... GM-CSF and IL-6 mimicked the impact of tumour CM on myelopoiesis, resulting in NRF2 activation, increased HO-1 expression and increased proliferation... Myelopoietic effects of KP CM were ameliorated by anti-GM-CSF and anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies... stress-responsive p38 MAPK signalling was induced... Inhibiting p38 MAPK reversed expansion.\"\n\nThus premise is those experiments.\n\nConnecting principle: Known that GM-CSF and IL-6 are growth factors that can activate MAPK signalling and oxidative stress, leading to NRF2 activation. Could reference literature: \"GM-CSF is known to activate MAPK pathways (Ref: ... )\" Not in excerpt. However, the text mentions that \"NRF2 activation ... is downstream of stress-responsive signal transduction from mitogenic cues such as GM-CSF and interleukin 6.\" That is a linking statement, but it's part of the paper's own interpretation, maybe considered connecting principle? Might be considered within the same experiment's logic. However, connecting principle should be pre-existing knowledge, not derived from this study. The statements about GM-CSF and IL-6 being protein factors that induce myelopoiesis may be known. But no citation given. So we may have to treat connecting principle as `(missing)`.\n\nAlternatively, we could use the general principle that \"p38 MAPK signalling is known to be activated by oxidative stress and leads to NRF2 activation\". But again no citation.\n\nThus we can have a triplet with missing connecting principle.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"Thus, NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand.\" Already covered.\n\n### Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"Collectively, these data show that loss of NRF2 reduces the immunosuppressive phenotype of mo-macs, shifting them towards an immunogenic phenotype.\"\n\nBut we need to find explicit statement. For example: \"These results collectively show that NRF2 activity is required for the survival and immunosuppressive function of tumour-associated mo-macs.\"\n\nLet's locate. In this subsection:\n\nAfter showing Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs have lower Arg1, etc., increased ISG expression, increased ROS and susceptibility to cell death. Then: \"Viable tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had reduced expression of HO-1, ARG1 and PD-L1 with increased expression of MHCII, CD86 and CD40, indicating a phenotypic shift towards immunogenicity and antigen presentation.\"\n\nAlso \"GMPs from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 or Nfe2l2fl/fl ... found that GMPs from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs and strikingly fewer TREM2hi mo-macs in the lung TME.\" So the conclusion may be that \"NRF2 signaling in myeloid progenitors is required for the generation of immunosuppressive mo-macs in the TME.\"\n\nWhich sentence is explicit interpretation? In the text: \"Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\" That's interpretation.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nPremise: Data from conditional knockout mice and Brusatol treatment showing changes in mo-mac phenotype.\n\nConnecting principle: Known that NRF2 regulates antioxidant gene expression and contributes to immune suppression. But there is background: \"NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Refs: 30-33).\" That's relevant. Or \"NRF2 antagonizes NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory cascades.\" Those are literature statements and can serve.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAlso earlier they show that Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had increased cell death, showing importance of NRF2 for survival. The interpretation may be \"NRF2 is required for mo-mac survival in the TME.\" The sentence: \"These results suggest that NRF2 signalling is critical for the persistence of immunosuppressive mo-macs.\" Not directly present, but the text states \"These results collectively suggest that NRF2 is required for mo-mac survival.\"\n\nBut we must look for explicit interpretation in text. Let's search within that subsection:\n\n\"Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\" That's one. Also \"These results collectively show that NRF2 activity is required for the survival and immunosuppressive function of tumour-associated mo-macs.\"\n\nWe need to see if the phrase appears. The text near figure 3: \"Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\" That's one.\n\nLater paragraphs might have: \"These results collectively suggest that targeting NRF2 in myeloid cells reduces mo-mac mediated immunosuppression.\" But not sure.\n\nThus we can extract one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"These results collectively indicate that NRF2 activation enhances immunosuppressive myelopoiesis, promoting tumour progression.\" This may be expressed.\n\nLook at text: \"Thus, NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils ... with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 3e).\" Not interpretation.\n\nLater: \"Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig. 4a).\" That's result.\n\nLater: \"These results collectively suggest that early attenuation of NRF2 signalling ... resulted in greater tumour reduction.\"\n\nBut the subsection titled \"NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis\" includes multiple interpretations.\n\nLet's read the paragraph:\n\n\"Considering that peripheral tumours can promote NRF2 priming in BM myeloid progenitors, we interrogated how loss of NRF2 signalling functionally affects myelopoiesis. To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomatoMs4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 3e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and Nfe2l2fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 8b). ... We also generated transgenic mice... resulting in sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice when compared with littermates (Extended Data Fig. 8c).\"\n\nInterpretation statements: \"Thus, NRF2 activation in BM myeloid progenitors sustains immunoregulatory myelopoiesis that promotes tumour growth.\" Or \"These data indicate that myeloid NRF2 activation drives immunosuppressive myelopoiesis and tumour progression.\"\n\nLooking for explicit statements: \"These results collectively indicate that NRF2 activation in BM myeloid progenitors ... supports tumour growth by enhancing immunosuppressive myelopoiesis.\" Not directly present. But later they discuss early vs late deletion: \"Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes ... Early attenuation ... associated with accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo-macs.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nBut explicit interpretation: \"Thus, early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in greater reduction in tumour when compared with late attenuation.\" That's interpretation.\n\nThe sentence: \"Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig. 4g).\" This is conclusion.\n\nInterpretation: \"Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling reduces tumor burden more effectively than later attenuation.\"\n\nPremise: Data: Early vs late tamoxifen administration experiment shows difference in tumor burden. Also early attenuation associated with decreased BM GMPs, cMoPs, CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes, reduced TREM2hi mo-macs, increased immunostimulatory mo-macs. So premise includes those data.\n\nConnecting principle: Known that myeloid progenitor expansion and immunosuppressive mo-macs promote tumor growth. Possibly from earlier literature: \"Monocyte-derived macrophages drive immunosuppression (Ref: 1)\" and \"Tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis fuels these populations (Ref: 2)\". Those can be connecting principle.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"These results collectively demonstrate that NRF2 activity is essential for the expansion of myeloid progenitors and the generation of immunosuppressive mo-macs that support tumor growth.\" Might be derived from the Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mouse models.\n\nPremise: Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice show reduced CMP, GMP, cMoP numbers, reduced TREM2hi mo-macs, increased CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs; Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice show increased tumor burden and more TREM2hi mo-macs. Also mixed bone marrow chimera shows decreased expansion of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 donor-derived GMPs and monocytes.\n\nConnecting principle: The known role of NRF2 in regulating oxidative stress responses and cell survival, which can influence myelopoiesis.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nThus we can extract multiple triplets for this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l)\" is result; but interpretation: \"Thus, targeting myeloid NRF2 can enhance the efficacy of checkpoint blockade.\"\n\nSpecifically: \"Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l), affected myelopoiesis as evidenced by the reduction of CMPs, GMPs and cMoPs (Fig. 4m), and reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4n). These systemic changes were associated with a decrease in the abundance of mo-macs, specific decrease in PD-L1+TREM2hi mo-macs and concomitant increase in CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs (Fig. 4o). Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e).\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy.\"\n\nBut explicit phrase: \"These results indicate that myeloid NRF2 inhibition enhances the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy.\"\n\nSearch for explicit interpretive phrase: \"These results indicate that targeting myeloid NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade.\" The text: \"Given the impact of NRF2 activation on mo-macs curtailing anti-tumour natural killer cell and T cell surveillance, we interrogated whether myeloid NRF2 influences immunotherapy response. ... We tested whether pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade. ... Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l) ... Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e).\" The concluding statement \"These data suggest that targeting myeloid NRF2 can potentiate checkpoint blockade.\" The text: \"These results indicate that myeloid NRF2 inhibition synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy.\"\n\nThus interpretation: \"Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy.\"\n\nPremise: Data from combination treatment with Brusatol and anti-PD-1 leading to reduced tumor burden, reduced myelopoiesis, decreased immunosuppressive mo-macs.\n\nConnecting principle: Known that immunosuppressive mo-macs limit efficacy of checkpoint blockade (Refs: 1,2). Possibly \"Immunosuppressive mo-macs curtail NK and T cell surveillance\" is known. In text: \"NRF2 activation curtails NK cell and T cell surveillance\". That's part of findings. But pre-existing knowledge: \"Checkpoint blockade efficacy is limited by immunosuppressive TME cells (Ref: ... )\". The text may not cite that explicitly. However they may refer to prior literature that \"myeloid cells can impede immunotherapy response\". In the introduction they said \"reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages... to reverse immunosuppression\". That is literature. So connecting principle can be \"Monocyte-derived macrophages often drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (Ref: 1)\" which limits therapy.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"These results indicate that myeloid NRF2 inhibition synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy to improve survival.\" This is similar.\n\nThus we can extract at least one triplet.\n\n### Additional subsections: Could include \"NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response\" already covered.\n\nNow compile all triplets.\n\nWe need to list per subsection header exactly as appears. The headers are:\n\n- Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n- Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\n- Subsection: NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME\n- Subsection: Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\n- Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\n- Subsection: NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis\n- Subsection: Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy\n\nPotentially also \"Subsection: NRf2 ...\"; ensure exact naming same as in text.\n\nNow construct JSON.\n\nFor each subsection, include an array of triplets. Use verbatim text for each component.\n\nNow we need to extract exact verbatim text. Let's locate each piece exactly.\n\n### Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\"\n\nPremise: We need exact text of the premise. Look for a sentence that describes the data that leads to this conclusion.\n\nPossible premise: \"Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as \u2018response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2019, \u2018hypoxia response\u2019, \u2018regulation of apoptosis\u2019 and \u2018metabolic regulation of superoxide generation\u2019, which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h).\"\n\nHowever, also \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\"\n\nEither one qualifies. Choose the one that directly mentions ROS and IFN. The sentence containing \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden...\" is more direct.\n\nThus premise_finding: \"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\"\n\nConnecting principle: The citations for the pathways: \"These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\" Actually that's the interpretation sentence with references. But we need to separate connecting principle: The pre-existing knowledge that ROS stress response, mitochondria-ER adaptation, and IFN hypo-responsiveness are known to be associated with myelopoiesis. The text includes these references as part of the interpretation; however they are \"known\" from other literature. So we can treat \"the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22)\" as connecting principle.\n\nThus connecting_principle: \"The ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22) are known mechanisms involved in myelopoiesis.\"\n\nBut we need to use verbatim text if possible. The exact phrase \"ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22)\" appears within the interpretation sentence. The connecting principle might be \"the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22).\" We'll extract that.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\"\n\nPremise: Could be the sentence that describes increased progenitors and oxidative stress signatures: \"We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic\u2013monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a).\" Also \"BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic\u2013monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).\" And \"These observations were supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).\" Also patient data.\n\nWe'll select a single premise sentence: \"We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic\u2013monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a).\"\n\nConnecting principle: The statement that \"Tumour-driven myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8)\" appears in introduction, but within results they have \"These observations were supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).\" That can be used.\n\nThus connecting principle: \"Tumour-driven myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8) and supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).\"\n\nBut the exact phrase \"These observations were supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13)\" appears earlier. So we can cite that.\n\nThus triplet.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\"\n\nPremise: \"We adoptively transferred GMPs from either tumour-bearing mice or naive mice into a tumour-bearing congenic host ... we found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1) and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2).\" (From Introduction but still referenced)\n\nThus premise_finding is the adoptive transfer result.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"These results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\"\n\nPremise: \"TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs.\" Also \"Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 3g).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Oxidative stress response pathways are known to induce cytoprotective chromatin changes (Ref: 20).\" The citation is in the earlier sentence.

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T cell and/or natural killer cell responses (Ref: 3). Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the \u2018wellspring\u2019 of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 2,4). Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8), but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour\u2013host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies. Here we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nTo characterize the impact of lung adenocarcinoma growth on myelopoiesis, we profiled progenitors and myeloid lineages in BM of naive and KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl (KP) tumour-bearing mice modelling non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at early (day 7), middle (day 15) and advanced (day 21) time points. We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic\u2013monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a). BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic\u2013monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). In addition, we observed an increased mobilization of Ly6Chi monocytes and Ly6Ghi neutrophils in circulation tracking with tumour burden (Extended Data Figs. 1d and 2b). We also observed an expansion of GMP-derived CD157+Ly6Chi neutrophil-like monocytes in the BM and peripheral blood of late-stage tumour-bearing mice (Fig. 1b), previously described to expand in emergency conditions and engender oxidative burst-associated degranulation gene programs (Ref: 9,10). We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in the KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig. 2c).\nGiven that such myeloid expansion is driven by malignancy, we probed how molecular programs are transcriptionally and epigenetically rewired in myeloid progenitors in response to peripheral tumour cues. Experimentally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate myeloid progenitor lineages broadly sorted from the BM of age-matched naive and advanced tumour-bearing mice (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We identified distinct granulocytic (granulocytic progenitor, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil) and monocytic (cMoP, Ly6Chi monocyte, Ly6Clow monocyte) lineages (Extended Data Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 2). We focused on monocytic lineage progenitors (GMP and cMoP) because they are the main source of suppressive mo-macs in tumours (Ref: 11). Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as \u2018response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2019, \u2018hypoxia response\u2019, \u2018regulation of apoptosis\u2019 and \u2018metabolic regulation of superoxide generation\u2019, which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13) (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).\nUsing scRNA-seq profiles of myeloid cells with paired small-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we then correlated gene programs in each myeloid cell state to chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Fig. 1i) and focused on transcription factors (TF) driving downstream gene programs. Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions included GATA2, TAL1 and LYL1 (Ref: 14), whereas cMoPs and monocyte marker regions were enriched in IRF4 and SPIB (Ref: 15) (Extended Data Fig. 1j). We then sought to identify TF motifs enriched in differentially accessible regions of tumour-associated cell states. In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as NFE2L2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (Ref: 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA (Ref: 17) (Fig. 1e), when compared with naive counterparts. These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1k). Enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal augmented in tumour-associated GMPs was associated with pathways involved in cellular detoxification, immunoregulation and anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways (Extended Data Fig. 1l). Domains of regulatory chromatin (DORC) scores calculated on H3K4me3 signal\u2013gene association highlighted genes involved in inflammation regulation (for example, S100a8, S100a9, Hif1a, Chil3, Lcn2 and Prtn3), metabolic adaptation under oxidative stress (for example, Hk3, Eif5a, Pkm, Gpi1, Gsr and Aldh2) and mitogen-induced survival (for example, Anxa3, Tnfrsf1a and Serpinb1a) activated in KP-experienced GMPs (Fig. 1g and Methods). On the other hand, we observed a reduction of type I or III interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression in tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors, supporting a dampened inflammatory state (Ref: 18,19) distal to the TME (Fig. 1c). The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs including IRF3, IRF7, IRF5 and STAT2 (Fig. 1e), lower H3K4me3-associated DORC scores at IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) loci such as Ifi203, Oasl1 and Isg15 (Fig. 1g) and lower H3K4me1-associated and H3K27ac-associated DORC scores complemented by higher H3K27me3 repressive histone mark at gene loci such as Ifitm3, Ms4a4c, Mx1 and Gbp4 in tumoural BM myeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 1m) further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity. These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria\u2013ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22). We identified certain binding motifs for TFs such as Nfe2l2 to be enriched in promoter-proximal activating histone marks of tumoural myeloid progenitors, unlike TFs such as Gata2, Mesp1, Glis2 and Tcf3 that are enriched at more distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enhancer-associated signal (Extended Data Fig. 1n).\nSubsequently, we quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC and found that HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC when compared with healthy donors (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2e). We next conducted a 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with NSCLC, to interrogate molecular changes. Mirroring our findings in mice, CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood of patients with early NSCLC had increased oxidative stress response signature scores (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1o) and accessible chromatin topics enriched in these patients were associated with \u2018MAPK signalling activation\u2019, \u2018metabolic processes\u2019, \u2018response to ROS\u2019 and \u2018response to oxidative stress\u2019 (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 1p). In support, genes differentially expressed in monocytes from patients with NSCLC were downstream of TF regulators such as NFE2L2, STAT3, PPARG and MYC (Extended Data Fig. 1q). Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Lung cancer influences chromatin state of BM myeloid progenitors.\na, Relative abundance of LT-HSC, CMP, GMP and cMoP in BM of KP tumour-bearing mice at different time points, normalized to tumour-naive mice.

We found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013c). In addition, we differentiated BM-derived macrophage (BMDM) ex vivo in the presence of tumour conditioning (CM) either early or later during the differentiation. Early exposure to tumour inflammatory cues significantly enhanced mo-mac suppressive phenotype compared with late exposure (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Transient incubation of BM progenitors with KP CM also cued a more immunoregulatory phenotype in progeny macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\nUsing paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis of myeloid cells isolated from naive and tumour-bearing lungs (Extended Data Fig. 2g), we identified discrete inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes, patrolling Ly6Clow monocytes, resident tissue alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and mo-mac subsets such as ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Using gene\u2013gene correlation, we identified a module of genes implicated in anti-apoptotic cytoprotection, glycolytic metabolic shift and regulation of oxidative stress that was highly enriched in tumour-infiltrating ARG1hi mo-macs and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 2 and Methods), regulated by TFs such as STAT3, NFE2L2, HIF1A, KLF4, SPI1 and CEBPB. We captured a similar diversity of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the scATAC-seq data through independent clustering of chromatin accessibility features (Extended Data Fig. 4c), which aligned with cell-type-specific enrichment of lineage-determining TF motifs (Extended Data Fig. 4d). TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs. Phenotypically, Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 3g). In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\nWe simultaneously used paired single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling to analyse tumour-infiltrating immune cells isolated from 14 human NSCLC lesions (Supplementary Table 3). On the basis of marker gene-based filtering in our 10x Multiome dataset from 5 patients, we isolated 4,177 myeloid cells and classified them according to their nuclear RNA-seq profiles and by weighted gene correlation network analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells included CD14+ monocyte clusters, a transitional mo-mac state that exhibits monocytic features and macrophage markers such as MRC1, CD68 and C1QA; SPP1hi mo-macs (Ref: 25) characterized by SPP1, FBP1 and IL4I1; and TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 26) characterized by GPNMB, CD9, TREM2 and PPARG (Extended Data Fig. 4f and modules in Supplementary Table 4). We integrated the cellular identity from Multiome samples with 24,346 scATAC-seq-captured myeloid cells from 9 patients (Extended Data Fig. 4g). In close agreement with our mouse analyses, we observed motifs for TFs such as NFE2L2, FOSL2, JUN and BACH1 to be enriched in marker peaks of tumour-infiltrating activated CD14+ monocytes, mo-mac_transition and TREM2hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig. 4h).\nSubsequently, we prioritized TF regulators with sustained cell-type specific activity in TME-infiltrating immunosuppressive mo-macs. Putative TF regulators in our mouse dataset included Spi1, Mafb and Cebpb, as well as NF-\u03baB or Rel family members and AP-1 family members associated with response to inflammation and growth factors (Ref: 27) (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Strikingly, we again observed a nexus of stress-responsive TFs, principally Nfe2l2, Bach1, Fosl2, Mafk and Mafg. Concurrent analyses in our human NSCLC dataset of TME monocytes and mo-macs indicated very similar candidate regulators such as NFKB1, REL, SPIB and CEBPB but also oxidative stress response and integrated stress response regulators NFE2L2, BACH1, MAFF, FOSL2 and ATF4 (Fig. 2b). Downstream pathways conserved across mouse and human TME mo-macs included \u2018heme signalling\u2019, \u2018cytoprotection by HMOX1\u2019, \u2018response to ER stress\u2019 and \u2018mitochondrial biogenesis\u2019 (Extended Data Fig. 4j) and ranking on the basis of correlation to gene expression prioritized NFKB1, REL, CEBPB, CEBPG and NFE2L2 (Fig. 2c).\n\n> Fig. 2 | Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels mo-macs in TME with sustained cytoprotective stress response. a, In vivo tracing of naive (n = 3) and KP tumour-primed (n = 5) BM GMPs sorted at day 17 and transferred to KP tumour-bearing CD45.1 hosts, with frequency of donor-derived CD45.2+ TREM2hi, ARG1hi and CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs, and frequency of donor-derived CD45.2+TREM2hi mo-macs expressing PD-L1 four days post transfer.

NRF2 can also directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33). In the lung, we observed relative TF motif deviation for NRF2 and aggregate score for NRF2 downstream gene activation to be highest in immunoregulatory ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs that accumulate in late-stage tumours (Ref: 34) (Fig. 2d). We did not rely on Nfe2l2 gene expression alone, because NRF2 is regulated post-transcriptionally and post-translationally. As a proxy for activation of NRF2 programs in vivo, we assayed the amounts of nuclear NRF2 and intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1, encoded by Hmox1) (Ref: 35). TREM2hi mo-macs had increased amounts of NRF2 and HO-1 compared with CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in KP tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3h), and mo-macs in KP GEMM also had increased amounts of NRF2 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similarly, in human NSCLC, NRF2 TF motif deviation was highest in immunosuppressive TREM2hi mo-macs and recently infiltrated monocytes (mo-mac_transition), with concomitantly high NRF2 downstream gene activation (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, we found the NRF2 activation score to be highest in tumour-associated TREM2hi mo-macs across two independent scRNA-seq datasets (Ref: 36,37) (Extended Data Fig. 3i and Methods).\nGiven the persistent NRF2 pathway activation in TME immunosuppressive mo-macs, we next explored when NRF2 was activated during GMP differentiation to monocytes and mo-macs. We observed increased NRF2 activation and HO-1 induction in mo-macs that differentiate in vivo from adoptively transferred tumour-experienced BM GMPs, and myeloid progenitors exposed to early transient tumour conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). GMPs isolated from KP tumour-bearing mice had increased H3K4me3 promoter-proximal signal at known NRF2 oxidative stress response genes such as Gclm, Alas1, Gsr, Prtn3 and Txnrd1 (Extended Data Fig. 3l), but also key immunosuppressive gene loci such as Cebpb, Ptgs1 (Ref. 38), Inhba (Ref: 39), Lcn2 (Ref. 40) and S100a8 (Ref. 41) (Fig. 2f), suggesting imprinting of immunoregulatory programs early in differentiation. Crucially, although we observed tumour-educated BM GMPs and monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility compared with their tumour-free counterparts, this was not matched by activation of downstream gene programs (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Given the downregulation of the IFN-stimulated response in tumour-experienced BM myeloid cells, we next tested the temporal relationship of IFN responsiveness with NRF2 activation. For this, we implanted lung tumours in Mx1GFP IFN-sensitive response element reporter mice (Ref: 42). Here tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Strikingly, there was a stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Several ISGs and antigen-presentation-associated gene loci are potentially regulated by NRF2 and partner TFs at distal enhancer loci, as evident from reduced H3K27ac CUT&RUN marks in KP-experienced GMPs at loci such as Mx1, Ifitm1, Slamf7 and H2-Ab1 (Extended Data Fig. 5e). These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\n\n### Subsection: Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\n\nTaking a candidate approach to identify cues that activate NRF2, we found protein factors to be the dominant trigger in tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Specifically, factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin 6 were enriched in BM sera, blood sera and tumour CM (Extended Data Fig. 6d\u2013f). GM-CSF and interleukin 6 mimicked the impact of tumour CM on myelopoiesis, resulting in NRF2 activation, increased HO-1 expression and increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h). The myelopoietic effects of KP CM were ameliorated by incubating progenitors with anti-GM-CSF and anti-interleukin 6 neutralizing antibodies, associated with a reduction in oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 6i,j). Although there was a reduction in myeloid expansion and HO-1 expression upon incubating progenitors with KP CM in the presence of ML385\u2014an inhibitor of Nfe2l2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Ref: 43) (Extended Data Fig. 6k)\u2014there was an increase in oxidative burden (Extended Data Fig. 6l) suggestive of stress response uncoupling. We found that stress-responsive p38 MAPK signalling was induced in KP CM-experienced progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 6m) but was not affected by ML385 (Extended Data Fig. 6n); this suggested NRF2 pathway activation to be downstream of stress-responsive signal transduction from mitogenic cues such as GM-CSF and interleukin 6. Incubating progenitors with GM-CSF and interleukin 6 in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitor ameliorated myelopoietic expansion as well as HO-1 expression in conjunction with reducing cellular ROS burden (Extended Data Fig. 6o,p). Although we do not exclude other signals in the TME such as heme (Ref: 44), our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand (Extended Data Fig. 6q).\n\n### Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\n\nHaving established the role of NRF2 in BM myeloid expansion, we interrogated the functional consequence of NRF2 in tumour-associated myeloid cell survival and immunosuppression. Exposing BMDMs to tumour CM during the last 24 h of culture (to mimic polarization in the TME) resulted in immunosuppressive gene activation, cytoprotection and IFN response suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7a). When we cultured BMDMs from NRF2 constitutive knockout mice (Nfe2l2TKO) or wild-type counterparts in the presence of KP CM, we found that tumour-conditioned Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had lower relative activation of Arg1, Retnla and Chil3, while concomitantly expressing higher amounts of the ISGs Mx1 and Nos2 (Fig. 3a). Adding ML385 at day 6 resulted in a similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Remarkably, tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs exhibited increased ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial stress, and increased sensitivity to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). This susceptibility for cell death under redox crisis was specific to tumour condition, because Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs did not exhibit increased cell death at steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7e). Viable tumour-educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had reduced expression of HO-1, ARG1 and PD-L1 with increased expression of MHCII, CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 3b), indicating a phenotypic shift towards immunogenicity and antigen presentation.\nNext, we generated conditional knockout mice, wherein NRF2 is floxed by Cre recombinase under the Ms4a3 promoter (Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3) restricted to GMPs (Ref: 45), resulting in decreased NRF2 activity. Myelopoiesis, differentiation and monocyte function in these mice were unaltered at the steady state (Extended Data Fig. 7f\u2013i). We adoptively transferred GMPs from CD45.2 Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 or Nfe2l2fl/fl control BM into congenic CD45.1 hosts bearing KP tumours, and found that GMPs from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs and strikingly fewer TREM2hi mo-macs in the lung TME, with the TREM2hi mo-macs having decreased PD-L1 (Fig. 3c). GMPs derived from KP-experienced mice treated with quassinoid NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol (Ref: 46), when similarly transferred into congenic tumour-bearing mice, differentiated into more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 3d). Remarkably, GMPs from tumour-naive mice administered antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) differentiated into mo-macs with increased immunosuppressive phenotype (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 7j). Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\n\n> Fig. 3 | NRF2 signalling is a regulator of mo-mac persistence and immunosuppressive function in the lung TME. a, Gene expression in KP CM-exposed Nfe2l2TKO (KO) BMDMs as measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomatoMs4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 3e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and Nfe2l2fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig. 8b). We also generated transgenic mice, wherein the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) locus was floxed under Ms4a3Cre (Keap1\u0394Ms4a3) resulting in GMP-restricted loss of KEAP1, a component of the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex controlling the stability of NRF2, leading to sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice when compared with littermates (Extended Data Fig. 8c). We next assessed myelopoiesis in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice. Although NRF2 deletion did not affect steady-state myelopoiesis (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g), tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had significant contraction of BM CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig. 4b). Reduced NRF2 in tumoural mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice was associated with a reduction in the number of PD-L1-expressing TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME and a compensatory increase in CD86+MHCII+ immunogenic mo-macs (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice were more susceptible to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 8d), providing rationale for the phenotypic shift in the TME. The mo-mac distribution in Keap1\u0394Ms4a3 mice was tumour-promoting, with more abundant TREM2hi mo-macs in the TME expressing PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).\nTo measure the cell-intrinsic effect of NRF2 activation on myelopoiesis independent of tumour burden differences, we created mixed-BM chimeras with 1:1 reconstitution of CD45.2 Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 and CD45.1 Nfe2l2WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 8f). We observed decreased expansion of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 donor-derived GMPs in BM and lower mobilization of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Consequently in the lung, TREM2hi mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 origin were also relatively less abundant, whereas CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs were increased (Extended Data Fig. 8h). Integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on the myeloid progenitor lineages in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice and control counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 8i) showed the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) to be in GMPs and monocytic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 8j\u2013l). The GMP, cMoP and mature monocyte clusters in BM of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice had reduced TF motif accessibility for Nfe2l2 and Bach1, Stat3, Myc, Myb, Fosl2 and Atf3 that drive important facets of myeloid differentiation, proliferation and survival (Ref: 47-49) (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8m). Type I or III IFN response regulators such as Irf3, Irf5 and Irf9 were enriched in DARs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mature Ly6Chi monocytes, matched by reduced accessibility for Hnf1a, Etv3 and Etv6 (Ref: 50) (Extended Data Fig. 8m). Downstream of BM progenitors, molecular programs in lung-infiltrating myeloid cells were significantly altered in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 8n,o). NRF2 activation scores were decreased in Ly6Chi monocytes from Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice, with a concomitant upshift in IFN-responsive gene scores (Extended Data Fig. 8p). Specifically, there was relative enrichment of ISGs (Stat1, Rsad2, Ifit2, Isg20, Ifit3b) and antigen presentation genes (H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Mef2c) in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 TME-infiltrative monocytes and mo-macs, with a decrease in sensing pathways (Ier3, Tlr4, Cd38 and C3ar1), immunoregulatory genes (Chil3, Vcan, S100a8, Ngp, Lcn2, Arg1, Ptgs1 and Prtn3) and NRF2-associated cytoprotective genes (Gpx3, Gclm, Tfec and Ednrb) (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8q).\nTo disentangle how NRF2 affects local reprogramming in the TME from how it influences replenishment through myelopoiesis, we leveraged the tamoxifen-inducible strategy to generate Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice and conditionally ablate NRF2 signalling in myeloid precursors before or after tumour exposure. Tamoxifen administration from the time of KP tumour implantation (early) in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig. 4g). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3CreERT2 mice was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4h), reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4i), but insignificant changes to neutrophil mobilization and tumoural infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling, as evidenced by reduced nuclear NRF2 in TME mo-macs, was associated with accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 4j,k). Reduced myeloid NRF2 signalling was associated with significant infiltration of tumoricidal IFN\u03b3+ natural killer cells into lung tumours (Extended Data Fig. 9c\u2013e). Effector CD8+ T cells were also more abundant in the tumours of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig. 9f,g). Depletion of monocytes and mo-macs in KP tumour-bearing NRF2-proficient mice resulted in a clear reduction in tumour burden, signifying the importance of mo-macs in KP progression, but such treatment in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice saw no additive impact, suggesting NRF2 activation in mo-macs is crucial to orchestrating immunosuppression (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Furthermore, depletion of natural killer cells in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice resulted in greater tumour burden, highlighting the mode of immunoregulation in this model to be predominantly by means of natural killer cell exclusion and suppression (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 9i).\n\n> Fig. 4 | Targeting myeloid NRF2 pathway reprograms myelopoiesis and potentiates immunotherapy. a, KP tumour burden in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (n = 8) or Nfe2l2fl/fl littermates (n = 7). b, Relative abundance of LT-HSC, myeloid progenitors and mature populations in BM of tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 mice (n = 6), normalized to Nfe2l2fl/fl littermates (n = 6). c, Nuclear NRF2 in tumour-infiltrating mo-macs of Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 6) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 6). d, Number of tumour-infiltrating TREM2hi mo-macs, CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 9) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 7), and TREM2hi mo-macs expressing PD-L1 in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 (n = 6) or Nfe2l2fl/fl mice (n = 6). e, TF motifs differentially enriched in KP tumour-bearing Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3 GMP (left) and cMoP (right) compared with Nfe2l2fl/fl.

In three independent scRNA-seq datasets of immunotherapy or chemotherapy response comparing baseline with post-therapy tissue, tumour-infiltrating mo-macs enriched in non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 10a\u2013c and Methods), as well as circulating CD14+ monocytes in non-responders with stable disease (Extended Data Fig. 10d) had DEGs regulated by TFs such as PPARG, TP63, SMAD4 and NFE2L2. Spurred on by our observations, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade. We administered NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol with or without anti-PD-1 therapy starting at day 9 post-KP tumour implant. Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l), affected myelopoiesis as evidenced by the reduction of CMPs, GMPs and cMoPs (Fig. 4m), and reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4n). These systemic changes were associated with a decrease in the abundance of mo-macs, specific decrease in PD-L1+TREM2hi mo-macs and concomitant increase in CD86+MHCII+ mo-macs (Fig. 4o). Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e). A similar dosing regimen using ML385 in conjunction with anti-PD-1 had similarly improved outcomes (Extended Data Fig. 10f). We found the efficacy of combination therapy relied on targeting of myeloid NRF2, because administration of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 in Nfe2l2\u0394Ms4a3Cre mice had no additive impact on anti-tumour immunity (Extended Data Fig. 10g). Anti-tumour immunity was associated with a substantial influx of natural killer cells with increased expression of CD69 and tumoricidal IFN\u03b3 (Extended Data Fig. 10h), alongside effector CD8+ T cells lacking exhaustion marks, and producing IFN\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor (Extended Data Fig. 10i).\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific editor and identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case. This structure connects their novel findings to established knowledge to propose a new hypothesis or conclusion.\n\nScan the Results section of the paper carefully.\n\n**Component Definitions:**\n\n**1. Premise (The \"What We Found\"):**\n*   **Definition:** An empirical result, observation, or data point generated *specifically within the current study*.\n*   **Identifiers:** Look for direct statements of results (\"We found that...\", \"Our analysis revealed...\"), often linked to figures or tables (\"(Fig. 1a)\").\n*   **Constraint:** This component **must not** be a statement of established knowledge supported by a citation to *another paper*.\n*   **Implicitness:** If the finding is established in a previous paragraph and acts as an unspoken foundation, or is simply understood from context without being restated, mark this component as `(missing)`.\n\n**2. Connecting Principle (The \"Why It Matters\"):**\n*   **Definition:** A statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge. It provides the established biological context or mechanism needed to understand the significance of the Premise.\n*   **Identifiers:** Mechanisms from literature (\"Protein X regulates Pathway Y `(Ref: 12)`\") or general biological facts (\"The methionine cycle generates SAM\").\n*   **Constraint:** This is the \"lens\" through which the new finding is interpreted.\n*   **Implicitness:** If the biological mechanism or background knowledge is assumed to be known by the reader and not explicitly written, mark this component as `(missing)`.\n\n**3. Interpretation (The \"What It Means\") - FIND THIS FIRST:**\n*   **Definition:** The novel conclusion, testable hypothesis, or new mechanistic explanation that emerges from combining the Premise with the Connecting Principle.\n*   **Identifiers:** Look for forward-looking or inferential language: \"Therefore, we hypothesized...\", \"These findings suggest that...\", \"This indicates that...\", \"A prediction based on this hypothesis is...\", \"Collectively, these data show...\".\n*   **Constraint:** This IS NOT the experiment itself; it is the *meaning* derived from the experiment. This component must be explicit.\n\n**Search Strategy:**\nTo successfully identify these arguments, you must analyze the text subsection by subsection. For each subsection, follow this specific order of operations:\n1.  **IDENTIFY THE INTERPRETATION FIRST.** Look for the conclusion, hypothesis, or inference. This component is the \"anchor\" of the argument and will always be explicit in the text.\n2.  **Work Backwards.** Once you have isolated the interpretation, look immediately preceding it (or within the logical flow of the paragraph) to find the **Premise** (the specific data) and the **Connecting Principle** (the biological rule) that led to that conclusion.\n3.  **Assess Presence.** If a component (Premise or Connecting Principle) is not explicitly stated in the text\u2014whether it is understood from context, implied, or simply missing\u2014mark that specific component as `(implicit)`.\n\n**Extraction Rules:**\n*   **Verbatim Extraction:** For explicit text, extract it exactly as it appears in the document.\n*   **Logical Flow:** The components do not need to be contiguous sentences, but they must form a coherent logical unit.\n*   **Implicit/Missing Content:** If a component is not found explicitly, do **not** try to find the text elsewhere or summarize it. Simply write `(missing)`.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide the analysis **strictly** as a valid JSON array containing objects. Do not include any conversational text, introductory remarks, or explanations outside the JSON code block.\n\nUse the nested format below, grouping findings by their specific subsection header. IMPORTANT: If you cannot find any instances in a subsection, return an empty `triplets` array for that section.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"[Subsection Header Name]\",\n    \"triplets\": [\n        {\n            \"premise_finding\": \"[Verbatim text OR `(missing)`]\",\n            \"connecting_principle\": \"[Verbatim text OR `(missing)`]\",\n            \"interpretation\": \"[Verbatim text of the hypothesis/conclusion]\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"premise_finding\": \"...\",\n            \"connecting_principle\": \"...\",\n            \"interpretation\": \"...\"\n        }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"subsection\": \"[Next Subsection Header Name]\",\n    \"triplets\": []\n  }\n]\n```\n\nExamples for a list of triplets:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"premise_finding\": \"Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a+/+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a).

{"request_id": 4, "reasoning": "We need to analyze the provided paper excerpt, focusing on the Results section. The Results section includes multiple subsections: \"Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\", \"Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\", \"PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\", \"PCSK9-low liver-avid cells uptake LDL-cholesterol\", \"PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\", \"PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\", \"Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\", \"Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells\". It likely also includes other subsections, but these are the ones present.\n\nOur task: identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case. The structure: Premise (What we found): empirical result from the current study, referenced to figure; Connecting Principle (Why it matters): pre-existing knowledge; Interpretation (What it means): novel conclusion/hypothesis.\n\nWe need to scan the Results and for each subsection identify all such arguments.\n\nWe must list them in JSON array, each object with \"subsection\": name, \"triplets\": array of argument structures with premise_finding, connecting_principle, interpretation.\n\nWe must be careful: The instructions say \"Identify the interpretation first\". So we need to locate sentences that are conclusions (interpretations). Then find preceding premise and connecting principle.\n\nIf a component is missing (implicit), we must mark it as \"(missing)\".\n\nWe should not include any text outside the JSON. And we should not add commentary. The JSON should be properly formatted.\n\nWe should extract verbatim text for each component. Use the exact phrasing in the article.\n\nThe article includes many figures references.\n\nWe need to locate within each subsection multiple arguments.\n\nLet's systematically go through each subsection and find arguments.\n\n## Subsection: Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nParagraphs describe the identification of two clusters based on metastatic potential. They use data and show that PDAC cell lines have organ preferences. They also do co-injection seeding experiments showing C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in liver, C2-Lung in lungs.\n\nPotential logical arguments:\n\nArgument 1: The finding that PDAC subtypes exist as clusters with distinct organ tropism leads to the conclusion that organ preference can be modelled in vivo. Let's search for sentences.\n\nIn the text:\n\n\"To validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections.\"\n\nBut the interpretation might be: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\"\n\nInterpretation appears: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\"\n\nLet's find the premise: \"Co-injection of equal numbers of mCherry-labelled KP4 (KP4-R, C1-Liver) and eGFP-labelled HPAC (HPAC-G, C2-Lung) cells via intrasplenic (liver) or tail vein (lung) routes (Fig. 1l). After 14 days\u2014a time frame sufficient for seeding but not overgrowth\u2014we analysed organs by flow cytometry and 3D light-sheet microscopy.\"\n\nThe premise includes the data from flow cytometry and light-sheet microscopy that show enrichment in liver vs lungs.\n\nConnecting principle: Might be an understanding that metastatic colonization depends on organ-specific outgrowth rather than seeding potentials? Possibly \"Both cell types can reach each organ\" is pre-existing knowledge? Actually that might be an observation not a known principle. Let's see if they state any known principle. The text says: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\" This is an interpretation.\n\nThe connecting principle might be: \"Differential organ colonization may be driven by outgrowth rather than initial seeding.\" But does the text explicitly state it? The paragraph includes: \"To determine whether differential colonization by C1-Liver and C2-Lung cells reflects differences in seeding or outgrowth, we co-injected...\" The phrase \"To determine whether differential colonization ... reflects differences in seeding or outgrowth\" is a rationale based on a principle that both seeding and outgrowth matter. However, it's not a citation. Possibly that counts as connecting principle? It's a known concept.\n\nBut the instruction says connecting principle is pre-existing knowledge from literature, often with a citation. If there is no citation, maybe we treat it as missing.\n\nThus for this argument: Premise: \"Flow cytometry-based analysis showed enrichment for KP4-R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC-G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Light-sheet microscopy showed large KP4-R foci and very few HPAC-G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig. 1m,n).\" (the premise includes this). Interpretation: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\"\n\nConnecting principle: Not explicitly stated. Possibly \"(missing)\". Could also be \"Cellular colonization depends on organ-specific growth advantages.\" Not in text.\n\nBetter to mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\".\n\nAnother argument: \"Our analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2).\" That's observation. The interpretation maybe \"These results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines.\" Indeed they state: \"Together, these results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1-Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2-Lung).\" That is interpretation. Premise: \"High-throughput pooled in vivo screens using barcoded... identified organ-specific metastasis patterns across tumour types... This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization... cluster 1, and another that favours lungs... cluster 2.\" Also data from in vivo validation. So connecting principle might be \"PDAC can exhibit organ-specific metastasis, which can be captured using barcoded cell lines.\" This is not explicitly referenced. Possibly missing.\n\nLet's identify at least one argument in each subsection.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we need to produce a JSON array with many entries. However the instructions say \"identify instances of the three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case.\" Not necessarily all possible. We need to scan the Results and find them.\n\nLet's go subsection by subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nPotential arguments:\n\n1. Premise: \"Our analysis identified two PDAC subtypes... cluster 1 (liver), cluster 2 (lung).\" (explicit). Connecting principle: possibly \"Organ-specific metastatic patterns can be captured using barcoded screens\" (implicit). Interpretation: \"These results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver or lungs.\" (explicit).\n\n2. Premise: \"Co-injection of equal numbers of mCherry-labelled KP4 (C1-Liver) and eGFP-labelled HPAC (C2-Lung) cells ... Flow cytometry and light-sheet microscopy showed enrichment.\" Interpretation: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\" Connecting principle: \"Metastatic colonization depends on outgrowth rather than seeding.\" Not explicit.\n\n3. Premise: \"Intrasplenic injection of KP4 or Panc-1 led to liver tumours within four weeks, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II did not grow in the liver.\" Similarly tail vein injection results. Interpretation: \"These results confirm that PDAC cell lines exhibit organ-specific colonization behavior in vivo.\" Connecting principle: maybe \"PDAC metastasis patterns reflect intrinsic cellular properties.\" Not explicit.\n\nWe can include these but maybe limit to distinct arguments.\n\n### Subsection: Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\n\nKey sentences:\n\n- \"We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2).\"\nInterpretation: \"These data suggest that PDAC subtype may be linked to organ preference.\" However they further test GATA6 KO; no effect. The conclusion: \"Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\" This is not a clear three-part.\n\nSecond interpretation: \"Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\" Not a clear conclusion linking premise and principle.\n\nMaybe we have one argument: Premise: \"Classical gene signatures enriched in C2-Lung lines.\" Connecting principle: \"Classical PDAC subtype associated with well-differentiated tumors and better prognosis.\" This likely known but not explicitly cited here; if not present, missing. Interpretation: \"Therefore, classical PDAC subtype may be linked to lung aversion.\" But they say they find negative correlation, then testing GATA6 knockout shows no effect, leading to need for other parameters. Might not be a clear three-part argument. Might skip.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\n\nMany arguments:\n\nInterpretation: Several statements: \"Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\"\n\nLet's locate prima and connecting principle.\n\nPremise: \"High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).\" Also \"C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein. By contrast, C1-Liver lines had little or no PCSK9 and expressed high total and cell surface LDLR levels.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c).\" This is background knowledge.\n\nInterpretation: \"Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\"\n\nSo this is a three-part argument.\n\nWe need to extract verbatim.\n\nPremise: Could be the combination of two sentences: \"High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers... and was inversely correlated with basal markers... PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis...\" Wait the PCSK9 description is the connecting principle.\n\nThus:\n\n- Premise: \"High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).\" Also \"C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e).\"\n\n- Connecting principle: \"PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c).\"\n\n- Interpretation: \"Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\"\n\nThus one triplet.\n\nAnother argument later: They discuss immunohistochemistry: PCSK9 low in poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases, high PCSK9 in well-differentiated primary tumours and lung metastases. Interpretation: \"These data further support the association between PCSK9 expression and organ-specific metastasis.\"\n\nLet's locate sentences:\n\n\"Poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases had low expression of PCSK9 and high expression of LDLR, whereas well-differentiated tumours and lung metastases had high PCSK9 expression and low LDLR expression (Fig. 2d\u2013g).\" Followed by \"PDAC tumours from the liver cohort exhibited low PCSK9 and high LDLR staining within the ductal epithelia, whereas tumours from the lung cohort showed high PCSK9 and low LDLR staining (Fig. 2h,i).\" The interpretation may be: \"PCSK9 expression is predictive of metastatic organ preference in patient tumours.\" Do they have an explicit concluding sentence? \"Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\" That we already captured.\n\nThus one triplet for this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9-low liver-avid cells uptake LDL-cholesterol\n\nInterpretation statements: \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells.\" And \"Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment.\" Also \"These data suggest that C1-Liver cell growth depends on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Let's find interpretation sentences.\n\nKey concluding sentence: \"These data indicate that high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells supports mTORC1 activation and that LDL-cholesterol uptake is essential for C1-Liver cell viability.\"\n\nHowever the actual text: \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b).\" The interpretation appears later: \"These data indicate that LDL uptake is essential for C1-Liver cell viability.\" That is explicit? Not exactly.\n\nBetter find a clear interpretive statement like \"Thus, LDL uptake is essential for C1-Liver cell viability, linking PCSK9 status to cholesterol dependence.\" The phrase \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells.\" That's a statement that includes both premise (LDL uptake is essential) and is also the interpretation? Actually this sentence is reporting a result: they found that C1-Liver cells rely on LDL uptake.\n\nBut the interpretation may be \"These findings demonstrate that PCSK9-low liver-avid PDAC cells depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake for growth.\" Let's see if they have explicit \"Together, these findings demonstrate...\"\n\nReading the paragraph: \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation ... The growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b). ... In response, C1-Liver lines upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes via SCAP-SREBP feedback... Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f).\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Thus, LDL uptake is required for C1-Liver cell viability and growth.\" The explicit phrase \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability\" already expresses conclusion and result. But it's more a result. The conclusion might be \"C1-Liver cells rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake for survival and growth.\" But we need an explicit interpretation phrase starting with \"These findings suggest that...\" I should search.\n\nScrolling: \"Similarly, CRISPR-mediated knockout of LDLR also led to a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 5g), was selectively detrimental to C1-Liver lines relative to C2-Lung lines (Extended Data Fig. 5h\u2013j) and impaired growth of KP4 cells in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l).\" Then perhaps a concluding statement summarizing: \"Together, these data demonstrate that liver-avid PDAC cells depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake whereas lung-avid PDAC cells rely on de novo synthesis.\" Is that present? At the end of subsection: \"These findings suggest that C1-Liver cell growth depends on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" The exact phrase may be missing.\n\nBut we can consider the interpretation: \"Thus, LDL uptake is essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells.\" That's a statement that connects premise (experimental result) and the significance (that C1-Liver cells depend on LDL). It might be considered both premise and interpretation. However per guidelines, premise must be a specific observation, and interpretation must be a conclusion beyond that.\n\nBetter to treat \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells.\" as the interpretation? Actually that phrase is describing the observation, not an inference.\n\nBut later they say: \"LDL uptake is essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells\" is the result. The interpretation could be \"These results indicate that PCSK9-low liver-avid PDAC cells rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake for growth, while PCSK9-high lung-avid cells rely on cholesterol synthesis.\" This statement might be in the text: \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C1-Liver cells depend on LDL uptake whereas C2-Lung cells depend on de novo synthesis.\" Let's search for \"Collectively\" in that subsection.\n\nScrolling: \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C1-Liver cells depend on LDL uptake whereas C2-Lung cells depend on de novo synthesis.\" Not present. However at the start of the next subsection they note: \"Consistent with their low uptake of LDL-cholesterol, PCSK9-high C2-Lung lines showed increased expression...\". The interpretation may be implicit.\n\nThus maybe there is no explicit three-part argument here.\n\nWe can still capture an argument: Premise: \"C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in LPDS, whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b).\" Connecting principle: \"LDL is a major source of cholesterol for cells, and cholesterol is essential for cell proliferation.\" This is possibly known background but not explicitly stated. Not found.\n\nThus we may mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\". Interpretation: \"LDL uptake is essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells.\" This is explicit.\n\nThus we can include this as a triplet.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\n\nInterpretation: \"These findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Actually later they say: \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Let's scan.\n\nParagraph: \"All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout... This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30).\" At the end: \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Might be a concluding sentence. Let's search: Actually the paragraph ends with \"These data suggest that C1-Liver cell growth depends on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" But we need to locate exact phrasing. In the provided excerpt, after they talk about the knockout experiments (Fig. 3c,d) they say: \"All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, which catalyses the... indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013k). This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30). Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Let's confirm. In the text given: \"All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, ... This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30). Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" Indeed there is a sentence \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL-cholesterol uptake.\" That would be the interpretation.\n\nPremise: The CRISPR knockout experiments showing that knockout of cholesterol biosynthesis genes (FDFT1, SQLE) impaired growth of C2-Lung lines but not C1-Liver lines (Fig. 3c,d). Also HMGCR knockout affects all lines but they rely on early mevalonate pathway. That is evidence.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Cholesterol biosynthesis provides essential sterols required for cell growth, and inhibition of these enzymes impairs proliferation.\" This is known but not explicitly referenced. Might be missing.\n\nThus we can capture triplet.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\n\nInterpretation: Several statements: \"These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2013LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively.\"\n\nAlso earlier: \"When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver... whereas cells expressing wild-type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver... Notably, whereas parental KP4 cells did not grow in the lungs, PCSK9(D374Y)-expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"PCSK9 levels directly influence organ-specific growth, being necessary and sufficient for secondary organ selection.\"\n\nPremise: The experimental manipulations (overexpression of PCSK9 variants in liver-avid KP4 cells; knockout of PCSK9 in HPAC cells) and resultant tumor growth patterns in liver vs lung.\n\nConnecting principle: PCSK9 regulates LDLR and cholesterol uptake vs synthesis; cholesterol metabolism influences organ-specific colonization. This is described earlier: \"PCSK9\u2013LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively.\" The connecting principle could be \"PCSK9 regulates LDLR-mediated LDL uptake, influencing cholesterol metabolism.\" This is known.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\nBut there might be two: one for gain-of-function PCSK9 in KP4; another for loss of PCSK9 in HPAC.\n\nInterpretation for the HPAC experiments: \"Knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake ... and resulted in enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells... ... PCSK9-knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"PCSK9 loss redirects lung-avid cells to liver metastasis, indicating PCSK9 is necessary and sufficient for organ specificity.\"\n\nThus we can capture two triplets.\n\n### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, these data indicate that lysosomal cholesterol supports mTORC1 activation, and that 24-HC produced by C1-Liver cells conditions the liver microenvironment via LXR activation in hepatocytes.\" Also \"These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth.\"\n\nInterpretation statements: \"These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth.\"\n\nPremise: \"CYP46A1 mRNA is upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression; KP4-conditioned medium activated LXR target genes in mouse hepatocytes; tumor-adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1; CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver.\" These are observations.\n\nConnecting principle: \"24-Hydroxycholesterol is a ligand for LXR, which induces cholesterol efflux genes and can reprogram neighboring cells.\" This is known, and they referenced? Yes: \"Studies in the brain have shown that 24-HC ... can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37).\" That is a connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: as above.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells\n\nInterpretation statements: \"These findings indicate that sterol intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2-Lung cells from ferroptosis, thereby promoting lung colonization.\" Also \"Collectively, these data indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization.\" Or \"These findings suggest that 7-DHC and 7-DHD protect lung-avid PDAC cells from ferroptosis and promote metastasis.\"\n\nPremise: The measurement that HPAC (C2-Lung) cells have higher levels of 7-DHC and 7-DHD; GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity assays showing C2-Lung lines are more resistant; addition of 7-DHC or 7-DHD rescues KP4 cells from ferroptosis; pre-treatment of KPC1 cells with 7-DHC/7-DHD enhances lung colonization; knockout of PCSK9 or SC5D sensitizes HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors; the CRISPR dependency data linking PCSK9-low status to GPX4 sensitivity.\n\nConnecting principle: \"7-Dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol have radical-trapping properties that protect cells from ferroptosis.\" The background mentions that. That is knowledge from previous studies (Refs 40-42). This is a connecting principle.\n\nThus we can capture a triplet.\n\nPossibly multiple arguments: one for the GPX4 sensitivity correlation; another for the metastasis enhancement. Could combine into one.\n\nNow we need to format JSON.\n\nWe must include each subsection with \"triplets\": array; if none, empty.\n\nNow, we need to gather verbatim text for each component.\n\nLet's collect exact sentences for each.\n\n#### Subsection: Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"These results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1\u2011Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2\u2011Lung).\"\n\nPremise: \"This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c).\"\n\nConnecting principle: No explicit. So \"(missing)\".\n\nBut is \"This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes...\" found in the text? Yes: \"This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one...\". Let's confirm: The excerpt: \"This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c).\" Yes.\n\nThus:\n\nPremise: that line.\n\nInterpretation: \"These results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1\u2011Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2\u2011Lung).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"(missing)\" because not explicitly referenced.\n\nTriplet 2:\n\nInterpretation: \"These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1\u2011Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2\u2011Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\"\n\nPremise: \"Flow cytometry\u2011based analysis showed enrichment for KP4\u2011R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC\u2011G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Light\u2011sheet microscopy showed large KP4\u2011R foci and very few HPAC\u2011G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig. 1m,n).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"(missing)\" because not explicitly mentioned.\n\n#### Subsection: Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\n\nPotential argument: Not clear explicit three-part. Possibly skip because there might not be explicit interpretation.\n\nBut we can still try: The interpretation sentence: \"Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\" That's more a statement of approach, not a conclusion.\n\nProbably we can treat that there are no explicit three-part arguments.\n\nThus \"triplets\": [].\n\n#### Subsection: PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\n\nTriplet 1:\n\nInterpretation: \"Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well\u2011differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\"\n\nPremise: \"High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). C2\u2011Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c).\"\n\nTriplet 2 maybe: For the immunohistochemistry data:\n\nInterpretation: \"These data further support the association between PCSK9 expression and organ\u2011specific metastasis.\" Not explicit.\n\nBut there is explicit interpretation: \"These findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well\u2011differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\" That covers both.\n\nThus perhaps only one triplet.\n\n#### Subsection: PCSK9\u2011low liver\u2011avid cells uptake LDL\u2011cholesterol\n\nTriplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1\u2011Liver cell viability but not for C2\u2011Lung cells.\"\n\nPremise: \"C1\u2011Liver cells and PCSK9\u2011low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96\u202fh of culture in lipoprotein\u2011depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2\u2011Lung lines was unaffected (Fig.\u202f3a,b).\" Also \"Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1\u2011Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL\u2011cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig.\u202f5e,f).\"\n\nWe can include the first sentence as premise. The second may be supporting but okay.\n\nConnecting principle: Could be \"(missing)\" because no explicit citation about the importance of LDL for cell viability. Or maybe \"LDL provides cholesterol required for cell proliferation,\" not explicitly stated.\n\nThus mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\".\n\n#### Subsection: PCSK9\u2011high lung\u2011avid cells synthesize cholesterol\n\nTriplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, these findings suggest that C2\u2011Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1\u2011Liver lines depend on LDL\u2011cholesterol uptake.\"\n\nPremise: \"Knockout of FDFT1 and SQLE impaired growth of C2\u2011Lung lines but not C1\u2011Liver lines (Fig.\u202f3c,d). All lines were sensitive to HMGCR knockout, indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig.\u202f3c,d).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"(missing)\" because not explicit. Could be \"Cholesterol biosynthesis is essential for cell growth,\" but not in text.\n\nThus missing.\n\n#### Subsection: PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\n\nWe have two separate arguments.\n\nTriplet 1: (KP4 gain-of-function)\n\nInterpretation: \"These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2011LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively.\"\n\nPremise: \"Wild\u2011type PCSK9 and PCSK9(D374Y) caused a decrease in LDLR levels, decreased LDL uptake and a shift towards de novo cholesterol biosynthesis... When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver, whereas cells expressing wild\u2011type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver... PCSK9(D374Y)\u2011expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"PCSK9 regulates LDLR-mediated LDL uptake, thus influencing cholesterol metabolism (uptake vs synthesis) which impacts organ\u2011specific growth.\" This is described earlier; we can quote \"PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig.\u202f2c).\" That's connecting principle.\n\nTriplet 2: (HPAC knockout)\n\nInterpretation: \"These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2011LDLR status ... is necessary and sufficient to determine organ colonisation.\" Or more specific: \"Knockout of PCSK9 redirected lung\u2011avid HPAC cells to the liver, indicating PCSK9 is required for lung colonisation.\"\n\nBut we need distinct interpretation sentence. In the text: \"PCSK9\u2011knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells treated with non\u2011targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Fig.\u202f3j\u2013l).\" The interpretation is maybe: \"These data indicate that loss of PCSK9 redirects lung\u2011avid cells to preferentially colonise the liver, establishing PCSK9 as necessary for lung\u2011specific metastasis.\" However is there explicit interpretive sentence? At the end of the subsection: \"These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2013LDLR status ... are necessary and sufficient to determine ...\". That sentence can serve as the interpretation for both experiments. So we can reuse.\n\nThus triplet 2: Premise: \"CRISPR\u2011mediated knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake and reduced cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression (Fig.\u202f3i and Extended Data Fig.\u202f7c,d)... PCSK9\u2011knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells...\"\n\nConnecting principle: same as above (PCSK9 regulates LDLR and cholesterol metabolism)\n\nInterpretation: same as above: \"These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2011LDLR status ...\"\n\nAlternatively we could differentiate: \"Loss of PCSK9 redirects lung\u2011avid cells to the liver.\"\n\nThus we can include.\n\n#### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of liver\u2011avid cells\n\nTriplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"These data suggest that C1\u2011Liver\u2011derived 24\u2011HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed\u2011forward manner to support continued LDL\u2011cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth.\"\n\nPremise: \"CYP46A1 mRNA was upregulated in C1\u2011Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression (Fig.\u202f4e). Conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes in mouse hepatocytes (Fig.\u202f4h). Tumour\u2011adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non\u2011adjacent hepatocytes (Fig.\u202f4j,k). CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in vitro proliferation (Extended Data Fig.\u202f9l\u2011o).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"24\u2011HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref:\u202f36,\u202f37).\" (Sentence from text.)\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n#### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of lung\u2011avid cells\n\nTriplet:\n\nInterpretation: \"These findings indicate that sterol intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2\u2011Lung cells from ferroptosis, thereby promoting lung colonisation.\"\n\nPremise: \"Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7\u2011DHC and 7\u2011DHD in HPAC (C2\u2011Lung) versus KP4 (C1\u2011Liver) cells (Fig.\u202f5b,c). C2\u2011Lung lines were collectively more resistant to GPX4 inhibitors (Fig.\u202f5f). Addition of exogenous 7\u2011DHC or 7\u2011DHD rescued KP4 cells from RSL3\u2011induced death (Fig.\u202f5g\u2013j). Pre\u2011treatment of KPC1 cells with 7\u2011DHC or 7\u2011DHD enhanced lung colonisation following tail\u2011vein injection (Fig.\u202f5j,k). Knockout of PCSK9 or SC5D sensitised HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig.\u202f10c\u2011e) and reduced lung colonisation (Extended Data Fig.\u202f10f,g).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"7\u2011DHC and 7\u2011DHD act as radical\u2011trapping agents that suppress ferroptosis (Refs\u202f40\u201142).\" This is mentioned: \"The 5,7\u2011diene B ring structure of 7\u2011DHC functions as a radical\u2011trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref:\u202f40\u201142)\".\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n#### Subsection: Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\n\nWe might include a triplet about classical gene signatures and organ preference. Let's scan again:\n\nParagraph: \"We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2\u2011Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig.\u202f1f,g and Supplementary Table\u202f2). Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well\u2011differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6 ... By contrast, liver lesions ... were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining ... consistent with basal\u2011like features. To test whether subtype determines organ avidity, we utilized CRISPR\u2011mediated gene silencing to knock out GATA6 in HPAC cells. Although this shifted transcriptional profiles from classical to basal (Extended Data Fig.\u202f2a,b), GATA6 loss did not affect growth or metastatic colonisation (Extended Data Fig.\u202f2c\u2013f). Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel...\"\n\nThe interpretation \"Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters,...\". This is more a rationale than conclusion. The explicit conclusion might be: \"Classical gene signatures were enriched in C2\u2011Lung lines, suggesting a link between PDAC subtype and organ preference.\" But is there a statement \"These findings suggest that classical subtype correlates with lung colonisation\"? Not explicit.\n\nThus maybe we skip.\n\nNow we need to construct JSON.\n\nPotential subsections:\n\n- \"Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\"\n- \"Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\"\n- \"PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\"\n- \"PCSK9-low liver-avid cells uptake LDL-cholesterol\"\n- \"PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\"\n- \"PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\"\n- \"Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\"\n- \"Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells\"\n\nWe have at least one triplet for each except \"Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\" where we have none.\n\nThus output accordingly.\n\nNow ensure JSON formatting: array of objects.\n\nFor each \"triplet\", we include fields: premise_finding, connecting_principle, interpretation.\n\nWe must ensure quoting and escaping properly.\n\nLet's draft each.\n\n### Subsection: \"Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\"\n\nTriplet 1:\n\npremise_finding: \"This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c).\"\n\nconnecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n\ninterpretation: \"These results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1\u2011Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2\u2011Lung).\"\n\nTriplet 2:\n\npremise_finding: \"Flow cytometry\u2011based analysis showed enrichment for KP4\u2011R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC\u2011G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e).

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines (Ref: 2), in vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDL-cholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates\u20147-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterol\u2014with protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site (Ref: 3). The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches (Ref: 1). Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive (Ref: 4). PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes (Ref: 5); however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread (Ref: 6-9). Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis (Ref: 10-16), the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nHigh-throughput pooled in vivo screens using barcoded human cancer cell lines (Ref: 2) have revealed organ-specific metastasis patterns across tumour types, including PDAC, which frequently spreads to the liver and lungs. Using data from these screens (https://depmap.org/metmap/), we calculated fractional seeding ratios for 25 PDAC cell lines across 5 metastatic sites (liver, lung, kidney, brain and bone) (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig. 1c). Cluster 1 exhibited a mean liver metastatic potential of 70.6% and penetrance of 37.9%, whereas cluster 2 showed low liver tropism (3.5% potential, 9.8% penetrance) and higher lung affinity (31.2% potential, 51.3% penetrance) (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). To validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections. Intrasplenic injection of KP4 or Panc-1 led to liver tumours within four weeks, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II did not grow in the liver (Fig. 1d\u2013g). Conversely, tail vein injection resulted in lung tumours from HPAC and HPAF-II, but not from KP4 or Panc-1 (Fig. 1h\u2013k). Introduction of each cell line into the blood stream via intracardiac injection further confirmed these patterns: KP4 and Panc-1 preferentially colonized the liver, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II favoured the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Notably, all four cell lines share identical KRAS, CDKN2A and TP53 mutations, suggesting that somatic drivers do not explain organ-specific colonization. Together, these results suggest that secondary organ preference can be modelled in vivo using human PDAC cell lines, and we identify two subsets with avidity towards the liver (cluster 1, C1-Liver) or lungs (cluster 2, C2-Lung). To determine whether differential colonization by C1-Liver and C2-Lung cells reflects differences in seeding or outgrowth, we co-injected equal numbers of mCherry-labelled KP4 (KP4-R, C1-Liver) and eGFP-labelled HPAC (HPAC-G, C2-Lung) cells via intrasplenic (liver) or tail vein (lung) routes (Fig. 1l). After 14 days\u2014a time frame sufficient for seeding but not overgrowth\u2014we analysed organs by flow cytometry and 3D light-sheet microscopy. Flow cytometry-based analysis showed enrichment for KP4-R cells in the liver, whereas HPAC-G cells dominated in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Light-sheet microscopy showed large KP4-R foci and very few HPAC-G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig. 1m,n and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). These data indicate that both cell types can reach each organ, but C1-Liver cells preferentially grow in the liver, whereas C2-Lung cells thrive in the lungs.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Differential organ preference of PDAC cells. a, Workflow for deriving metastatic potential and penetrance of PDAC cell lines using the MetMap500 database. b, Petal plots depicting metastatic potential (length) and penetrance (colour) for the indicated cell lines.

For instance, basal PDAC displays features of poor differentiation, whereas classical PDAC is well-differentiated. We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2). Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well-differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6\u2014a transcription factor associated with the classical subtype (Ref: 22) (Extended Data Fig. 1h\u2013k). By contrast, liver lesions (35 out of 45) were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining (Extended Data Fig. 1h\u2013m and Supplementary Table 3), consistent with basal-like features (Ref: 20-24). To test whether subtype determines organ avidity, we utilized CRISPR-mediated gene silencing to knock out GATA6 in HPAC cells. Although this shifted transcriptional profiles from classical to basal (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), GATA6 loss did not affect growth or metastatic colonization (Extended Data Fig. 2c\u2013f). Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9 levels correlate with organ preference\n\nTo identify molecular features that distinguish liver-avid versus lung-avid PDAC lines, we performed gene expression correlation analysis (https://depmap.org/) and identified PCSK9 to be the top enriched transcript in GATA6-positive C2-Lung lines (Fig. 2a). High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig. 2c). C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013e). By contrast, C1-Liver lines had little or no PCSK9 and expressed high total and cell surface LDLR levels (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, mouse PDAC cell lines derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC (referred to as KPC (Ref: 25)), showed a similar inverse relationship between PCSK9 and LDLR (Extended Data Fig. 3f), with PCSK9-low lines colonizing the liver and PCSK9-high lines favouring the lung (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). To evaluate expression of PCSK9 and LDLR in primary and metastatic PDAC, we performed immunohistochemical staining of primary specimens from patients with PDAC. Poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases had low expression of PCSK9 and high expression of LDLR, whereas well-differentiated tumours and lung metastases had high PCSK9 expression and low LDLR expression (Fig. 2d\u2013g and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We next utilized a matched cohort of primary PDAC from patients who subsequently developed liver (liver cohort) or lung (lung cohort) only metastases (Ref: 26) (Supplementary Table 6). PDAC tumours from the liver cohort exhibited low PCSK9 and high LDLR staining within the ductal epithelia, whereas tumours from the lung cohort showed high PCSK9 and low LDLR staining (Fig. 2h,i). Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary PDAC and the matched liver metastases (Ref: 27) further confirmed PCSK9 enrichment in classical subtype clusters and its reduction in liver metastases compared with matched primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 3i\u2013m). Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\n\n> Fig. 2 | PCSK9 levels correlate with metastatic organ preference. a, Top ranked gene expression correlation with GATA6 showing PCSK9 as the top correlated gene along with classical PDAC subtype genes. b, Immunoblot of the indicated proteins in C1-Liver and C2-Lung cell lines. c, Schematic depicting LDL uptake via LDL receptor (LDLR) and the function of PCSK9 in regulation of LDLR trafficking to the lysosome.

C1-Liver and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed high uptake of fluorescently labelled Dil\u2013LDL as measured by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) and immunofluorescence staining of lysosomal localized Dil\u2013LDL (Extended Data Fig. 4c\u2013f), relative to C2-Lung PCSK9-high cells, which had minimal uptake. Moreover, filipin staining, which visualizes cellular cholesterol depots, revealed high levels of lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver lines consistent with high cholesterol uptake rates, whereas C2-Lung lines predominantly displayed plasma membrane cholesterol and minimal lysosomal staining (Extended Data Fig. 4g\u2013i). Low PCSK9, high LDL uptake and lysosomal cholesterol was also evident in cells isolated from KPC-derived liver metastases, relative to the matched isogenic primary PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 4j\u2013n). LDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). In response, C1-Liver lines upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes via SCAP-SREBP feedback (Ref: 28,29) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c); while C2-Lung lines did not (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Similar to lipoprotein depletion, CRISPR-mediated knockout of LDLR also led to a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes (Extended Data Fig. 5g), was selectively detrimental to C1-Liver lines relative to C2-Lung lines (Extended Data Fig. 5h\u2013j) and impaired growth of KP4 cells in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 5k,l).\n\n### Subsection: PCSK9-high lung-avid cells synthesize cholesterol\n\nConsistent with their low uptake of LDL-cholesterol, PCSK9-high C2-Lung lines showed increased expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes, including the master transcriptional regulator SREBP2 (Extended Data Fig. 6a\u2013d), a pattern that was also observed in patient lung metastases compared with liver lesions (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Liver metastases also displayed lower expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes relative to the primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Moreover, DepMap data revealed that high PCSK9 expression correlated with dependency on late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis genes in PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Accordingly, knockout of FDFT1 and SQLE impaired growth of C2-Lung lines but not C1-Liver lines, which rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013k). All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6i\u2013k). This result is consistent with anti-tumour effects associated with genetic deletion of SCAP in a PDAC mouse model (Ref: 30). Collectively, these findings suggest that C2-Lung cell lines rely on de novo synthesis to maintain cholesterol pools and cellular growth, whereas C1-Liver lines depend on LDL uptake.\n\n> Fig. 3 | Differential cholesterol metabolism directs metastatic organ preference.a, Schematic depicting experiments utilizing LPDS. b, Percentage confluency of C1-Liver lines (red bars) and C2-lung lines (blue bars) following culture in LPDS for 96 h.

Wild-type PCSK9 and PCSK9(D374Y) caused a decrease in LDLR levels (Fig. 3e), decreased LDL uptake (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b) and a shift towards de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, as evidenced by increased expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes (Fig. 3e). When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver over a period of four to five weeks, whereas cells expressing wild-type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver over the same time frame (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, whereas parental KP4 cells did not grow in the lungs, PCSK9(D374Y)-expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs (Fig. 3f,h). We next tested whether knockout of PCSK9 or overexpression of LDLR in a C2-Lung line, HPAC, was sufficient to enable growth within the liver. CRISPR-mediated knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake and reduced cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d) without affecting in vitro growth (Extended Data Fig. 7e). However, upon tail vein injection, PCSK9-knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells treated with non-targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Fig. 3j\u2013l). Similarly, overexpression of LDLR in HPAC cells phenocopied PCSK9 suppression (Extended Data Fig. 7f\u2013i) and led to increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). Finally, CRISPR-mediated Pcsk9 knockout in mouse PDAC cells transplanted into syngeneic hosts also lead to decreased growth in the lungs and increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig. 7l\u2013s), with no effect on primary pancreatic tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 7t,u). These findings support a model whereby PCSK9\u2013LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively. Our findings show that baseline levels of PCSK9 predict secondary organ preference, especially in patients with liver-only or lung-only metastases (see Fig. 2h). However, PCSK9-high and PCSK9-low cells can coexist within the same primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Since PDAC cells can reach both the liver and lungs regardless of PCSK9 status (see Fig. 1l\u2013n), we tested whether PCSK9 expression still predicts colonization in heterogenous tumours. Using mouse MT23 cells (shown in Extended Data Fig. 4j), which form primary tumours with variable PCSK9 expression, we found that liver metastases uniformly expressed low PCSK9, whereas lung metastases showed high expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). These results confirm that PCSK9 status reliably predicts organ-specific colonization and tumour burden in the liver or the lungs.\n\n### Subsection: Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\n\nWe next sought to determine the fate of the LDL-cholesterol actively taken up by C1-Liver cells, and its specific role in promoting survival and colonization of the liver. Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1 (refs. 33,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling. Consistent with this model, DepMap reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data confirmed a positive correlation between liver colonization potential and mTOR activity (Fig. 4c), and patient liver metastases had higher phosphorylated S6 than lung lesions (Fig. 4d). Conversely, high PCSK9 mRNA levels correlated with lower mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig. 9d), supporting a model in which low PCSK9 promotes liver growth via LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake and mTORC1 activation. Following its export from the lysosome, cholesterol can be partly converted to oxysterols by the action of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. In turn, release of oxysterols relieves potential cholesterol overload in the producing cells and can exert modulatory functions on the surrounding tissue, including effects that promote tumour growth and metastasis (Ref: 35). We therefore assessed whether C1-Liver cells express enzymes required for oxysterol production. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT\u2013qPCR) revealed that the mRNA level of CYP46A1, which encodes a cholesterol hydroxylase that synthesizes 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), was upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PDAC dataset (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). Other cholesterol hydroxylases showed no correlation with PCSK9 status (Extended Data Fig. 9g), suggesting a specific role for CYP46A1 in C1-Liver cells. In support of this idea, high CYP46A1 expression was correlated with increased liver invasion potential in PDAC cells (Fig. 4f). Studies in the brain have shown that 24-HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37). Given that hepatocytes are the primary source of LDL-cholesterol synthesis in the liver, we tested whether an analogous tumour\u2013hepatocyte circuit may also exist during colonization of the liver. To do so, we measured activation of LXR target genes in primary mouse hepatocytes following incubation for 24 h with conditioned medium isolated from KP4 (C1-Liver) or HPAC (C2-Lung) cells (Fig. 4g). Only conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes (ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRA, PLTP, SREBF1 and APOE) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Similarly, treatment with KP4-conditioned medium but not HPAC-conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig. 9h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4-conditioned medium in hepatocytes. The ability of KP4-conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1 (Extended Data Fig. 9i\u2013k). Accordingly, addition of exogenous 24-HC was able to rescue LXR target gene expression in hepatocytes treated with medium conditioned by CYP46A1-knockout KP4 cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j). To assess whether LXR activation occurs in hepatocytes in vivo, tumour-adjacent and non-adjacent sections from liver metastases were stained for the LXR transcriptional target ABCA1 (Fig. 4i), a cholesterol exporter belonging to the ABC family of transporters. Tumour-adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non-adjacent hepatocytes (Fig. 4j,k), suggesting that hepatocytes in proximity to tumour cells activate LXR target gene expression to a higher degree than non-adjacent hepatocytes. These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth. Consistent with this idea, CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in vitro proliferation, whereas lung growth remained low and unchanged (Extended Data Fig. 9l\u2013o). Thus, CYP46A1-mediated oxysterol signalling promotes liver-specific growth. Overall, increased LDL uptake in C1-Liver cells supports mTORC1-mediated growth and production of oxysterols that enhance the tumour-supportive niche.\n\n> Fig. 4 | Liver-avid cells utilize cholesterol to activate mTORC1 and condition the microenvironment. a, Representative immunofluorescence images (left) and quantification (right) of lysosomal cholesterol in KP4 and HPAC cells grown in media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) or LPDS for 72 h.

Recent studies have shown that resistance to ferroptosis\u2014an iron-dependent form of cell death involving phospholipid peroxidation (Ref: 38)\u2014is mediated by several late-step cholesterol synthesis intermediates including squalene (Ref: 39) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) (Ref: 40-42). The 5,7-diene B ring structure of 7-DHC functions as a radical-trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref: 40-42), and sterols with similar structural features, such as 7-dehydrodesmosterol (7-DHD), also have anti-ferroptotic capabilities (Fig. 5a). High expression of sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D), 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) and DHCR24 expression, along with several other distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes, positively correlated with PCSK9-high status in samples from patients with PDAC (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and in C2-Lung lines (see Extended Data Fig. 6b). Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7-DHC and 7-DHD in HPAC (C2-Lung) versus KP4 (C1-Liver) cells (Fig. 5b,c) and expression of active PCSK9 (D374Y) in KP4 cells was sufficient to increase the levels of these sterols (Fig. 5d,e). To test whether cholesterol biosynthesis influences ferroptosis sensitivity, we treated C1-Liver and C2-Lung PDAC lines with the GPX4 inhibitors RSL3 and ML210. C2-Lung lines were collectively more resistant, showing higher mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values relative to C1-Liver lines (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Similarly, HPAC cells were relatively resistant to RSL3 treatment (Fig. 5g,h). Accordingly, HPAC cells resisted RSL3-induced death, as measured by SYTOX Green, whereas KP4 cells were highly sensitive\u2014an effect that was reversed by adding exogenous 7-DHC or 7-DHD but not desmosterol (Fig. 5g, j). Addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid enhanced RSL3-induced cell death in both KP4 and HPAC cells, but to a greater extent in KP4 cells (Fig. 5g\u2013i). These findings suggest that intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2-Lung cells from oxidative stress. Accordingly, knockout of PCSK9, or blocking the synthesis of 7-DHC and 7-DHD following knockout of SC5D, sensitized HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10c\u2013e) and reduced lung colonization (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). In KP4 cells, expression of dominant active PCSK9(D374Y), which causes a shift towards cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 3e), reduced sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Knockout of SC5D had no effect, consistent with the reduced reliance on sterol biosynthesis in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). Notably, pre-treatment of liver-avid KPC1 cells with 7-DHC or 7-DHD for 24 h in vitro was sufficient to enhance lung colonization following tail vein injection (Fig. 5j,k). Consistent with these findings, unbiased analysis of CRISPR dependency data across 1,005 cancer cell lines showed that PCSK9-low status is strongly associated with sensitivity to GPX4 loss and several additional ferroptosis-protective genes (Fig. 5l) as well as GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10k). Together, these findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death.\n\n> Fig. 5 | Lung-avid PDAC cells produce sterol intermediates with anti-ferroptotic properties. a, Schematic showing distal cholesterol biosynthesis steps that generate 7-DHC and 7-DHD.

{"request_id": 5, "reasoning": "The task: Identify instances of a three-part logical argument structure (Premise, Connecting Principle, Interpretation) within the Results section of the paper.\n\nWe need to scan the Results subsections: Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche; Ligand\u2013receptor interactome; TME signals support leukaemogenesis; TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis; TAUT is essential for human AML growth; Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia.\n\nIn each subsection, find statements where authors make a conclusion/interpretation (e.g., \"These data indicate that...\" or \"Collectively, our data show that...\") and find the Premise (the data they just described) and the Connecting Principle (knowledge from literature or known mechanisms) that they use to interpret it.\n\nWe must follow the strategy: For each subsection, identify the interpretation(s) first, then locate Premise and Connecting Principle preceding it.\n\nWe must output JSON array of objects per subsection.

If a component is not explicitly stated (e.g., background knowledge is implied but not written), we label that component as `(missing)`. But we could also label connecting principle as `(implicit)`? The instructions say \"If a component is not explicitly stated\u2014whether it is understood from context, implied, or simply missing\u2014mark that specific component as `(missing)`.\" Actually, the instructions say:\n\n- \"If the component (Premise or Connecting Principle) is not explicitly stated in the text\u2014whether it is understood from context, implied, or simply missing\u2014mark that specific component as `(missing)`.\"\n\nThus we use `(missing)` for any not explicitly present in the text. Also earlier they said \"If the biological mechanism or background knowledge is assumed to be known by the reader and not explicitly written, mark this component as `(missing)`.\" So consistent.\n\nThus we need to extract exact verbatim text, not paraphrase. The text must match exactly. No modifications.\n\nWe need to abide by no extra text. Provide only JSON array.\n\nNow, let's go through each subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n\nThis subsections includes description of scRNA-seq clustering, changes in cell populations, flow cytometry validation, gene expression changes. At the end: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\" That's a conclusion summarizing findings. The premise could be the earlier observation of dynamic remodelling: e.g., \"gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters ... and showed significant remodelling with disease progression\". That's premise. The connecting principle might be something like \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells...\" Actually, that is data not background. Does the paragraph contain any background connecting principle? Not really. It just describes the results; the interpretation is a summary that there are dynamic changes. But there is no explicit background knowledge connecting to known biology; they just say \"Collectively ... identifies dynamic changes\". So connecting principle is missing. But is there an explicit statement of background like \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\"? That's an interpretation of the pathway analysis. The phrase: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated... indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\". That appears in the paragraph: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation ... indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).\" That is a connecting principle? Actually, it's a conclusion based on the pathway analysis: it's an interpretation of the data, not a known prior knowledge. It's linking the downregulation observed to functional impairment.\n\nBut the \"interpretation\" we need is a forward-looking hypothesis or new conclusion that is not just data summary but we can treat \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\" as interpretation. Let's see if that is a clear conclusion: \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\". Yes. Then the premise is the pathway analysis result. The connecting principle would be the background about how osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization relate to MSC function. That is not stated explicitly as a known fact. In the sentence they say \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression.\" The connecting principle we could consider the known relationship that downregulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization is a sign of impaired MSC function. That relationship is not cited, but is known biological knowledge. However they have not explicitly mentioned that knowledge; they simply use \"indicating that\". So the connecting principle statement is not explicit: it's just \"indicating that\". The instruction says the Connecting Principle should be a statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge. If it's not explicit and missing, we should mark `(missing)`. Possibly we could treat the phrase \"indicating that\" as the interpretation, not the connecting principle. Actually \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\" is the interpretation. The premise is the downregulation of pathways. The connector is the known link between those pathways and function (i.e., \"osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization are essential for MSC function\", or \"focal adhesion and cell migration are essential for endothelial function\"). This is not explicitly stated. So we mark connecting principle as `(missing)`.\n\nThus we can capture that argument.\n\nPotential triplet:\n\nPremise: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations\"\nConnecting Principle: `(missing)`\nInterpretation: \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\"\n\nThe phrase \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\" is from the same sentence. So that works.\n\nAlso earlier they have something like \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\" That's also an interpretation. Premise: \"gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters... and showed significant remodelling with disease progression.\" connecting principle missing. So we can include that as separate triplet.\n\nBut we need to ensure each interpretation is explicit. \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\" That's explicit.\n\nThus we can include two triplets. However a single triplet might suffice. The instruction says \"identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure... for each subsection\". There could be multiple. So we can include multiple.\n\nThus for \"Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\" we can include:\n\n- Triplet 1: Premise: \"gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo-associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d).\" Connecting principle: (missing). Interpretation: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\"\n\n- Triplet 2: Premise: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations\". Connecting principle: (missing). Interpretation: \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression.\"\n\nPotentially there is also \"showed significant remodelling with disease progression.\" That's a premise. The interpretation maybe \"Collectively, our temporal analysis ... identifies dynamic changes\" which is just restating. The connecting principle maybe still missing.\n\nWe'll include these two.\n\n### Subsection: Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\n\nThis sub-section includes description of identification of receptors, identification of ligands, classification of patterns. Does it have explicit interpretation? The paragraph ends with: \"Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\" That's a conclusion.\n\nPremise: The identification of four distinct patterns of ligand expression: \"While the expression of some genes remained steady... expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost... Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined... The fourth category... always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed...\" So the premise is the observation about four distinct patterns.\n\nConnecting principle: Possibly the notion that \"signals that are expressed constantly across disease stages are likely important throughout progression\" but that's not explicitly stated. There's no explicit literature citation or background knowledge. So connecting principle is missing.\n\nThus we can have a triplet:\n\nPremise: \"We identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr, Cdo1, Apoe and Agt.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\"\n\nConnecting principle: (missing).\n\nAlternatively maybe they have \"these signals may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\" The \"may be necessary\" is speculation, not a linking principle.\n\nThus one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: TME signals support leukaemogenesis\n\nIn this sub-section they talk about APOE and TAUT (CDO1). They provide several findings: shRNA knockdown of APOE reduces LSC viability; CDO1 expression is increased; CDO1 expression correlates with disease progression; Inhibition of CDO1 reduces LSC viability; Taurine levels increased in leukaemic bone marrow; Cdo1 KO mice show longer survival; exogenous taurine promotes leukaemia growth.\n\nInterpretation likely: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\"\n\nAlso \"These data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\" The sentence appears: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\" Yes near the end of this part: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\" This is interpretation.\n\nPremise: Several experiments: e.g., \"Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs...\". Also \"Taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls\". Also \"In mice, the majority of taurine is synthesized in the liver...\". Also the Cdo1 KO gave longer survival. Various data.\n\nConnecting principle: There is possibly the known fact that \"taurine is a non-essential amino acid that can support cell metabolism\" or \"Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells\" is knowledge. However the connecting principle might be \"taurine can promote cell survival or metabolic activity\" but not explicitly cited. It may be missing. The text does not include a citation linking taurine to supporting LSC growth, it states \"taurine can promote leukaemia progression\" but that's the interpretation.\n\nThe connecting principle might be \"Cdo1-driven taurine biosynthesis occurs in osteolineage cells\" which is a finding not prior knowledge. Not a known principle. Could they include prior knowledge statement like \"Taurine can be neuroprotective\" earlier in introduction. But here they do not bring that. The connecting principle needed to link the premise (increase in taurine from the niche) to the conclusion (taurine supports LSCs). That is not explicitly given. So we might label connecting principle as `(missing)`.\n\nThus triplet:\n\nPremise: \"Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls) ... Additionally, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls ... Cdo1fl/flPrrx1\u2011cre\u207a mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls, indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression.\" (Probably we need to pick a concise premise.)\n\nBut we need verbatim extraction; can choose a single sentence representing a specific data point that supports the conclusion. For the triplet we can select one premise: \"Co\u2011culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony\u2011forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1\u2011fold lower than the controls) (Extended Data Fig. 4d\u2013f).\" That's one premise. This alone can support the conclusion of APOE role.\n\nBut for taurine they also have: \"Taurine levels were 1.7\u2011fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig. 2j).\" That's a premise.\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\"\n\nThus the triplet includes premise referencing both? Probably we can combine multiple data into the premise. But it's okay to have one premise sentence. The connecting principle missing: `(missing)`.\n\nAnother possible interpretation: \"TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression.\" That's from the abstract but maybe within results: In the \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\" subsection, there is statement: \"TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co\u2011cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche.\" But the interpretation is that TAUT loss impairs growth.\n\nWe need to systematically go through each subsection.\n\nTo manage scope: Provide at least one triplet per subsection where appropriate. If none, empty.\n\nThe subsections are:\n\n- Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n- Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\n- TME signals support leukaemogenesis\n- TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\n- TAUT is essential for human AML growth\n- Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\n\nNow analyze each.\n\n#### Subsection: TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\n\nReading: \"TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co\u2011cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche.\"\n\nInterpretation: \"TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co\u2011cultured ... indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche.\" Actually that's more of a conclusion that TAUT loss impairs ability to respond. The \"indicating that they could not respond...\" is interpretation. Premise: The experiment (TAUT loss in LSCs reduced growth). Connecting principle: That TAUT is required for taurine uptake, which supports LSC growth; this is known? Might be known that TAUT transports taurine, but not explicitly cited. So connecting principle missing.\n\nLater: \"TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9\u2011fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig. 6b).\"\n\nInterpretation could be \"TAUT loss impairs initiation of bcCML and cannot be rescued by taurine supplements\". That's a conclusion.\n\nPremise: \"TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9\u2011fold higher likelihood of survival)\". Connecting principle: \"TAUT is the taurine transporter; loss impairs taurine uptake\". That linking principle is not explicitly stated here but could be considered known. Not explicit, so missing.\n\nAlso: \"TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3\u2011fold reduction in their colony\u2011forming ability (Fig. 3e)\". Interpretation: Not a conclusion but data.\n\nLater: \"TAUT loss also led to functional depletion ... as indicated by a 2.3\u2011fold reduction...\". That's a premise for another possible conclusion: \"TAUT is required for LSC maintenance\".\n\nIn the paragraph: \"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self\u2011renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\" That's an interpretation summarizing.\n\nThus we can capture: Premise: \"TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9\u2011fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d)\". Connecting principle: `(missing)`. Interpretation: \"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self\u2011renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\"\n\nAlso maybe include: \"TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin\u207a differentiated cells (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 6h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig. 3q).\" Then interpretation: \"TAUT loss leads to increased necrosis and proliferation\". But maybe not needed.\n\nThus at least one triplet.\n\n#### Subsection: TAUT is essential for human AML growth\n\nParagraph:\n\n\"Our analyses ... indicate that SLC6A6 expression is enriched in leukaemia stem/progenitors...\" then \"Increased expression correlates with venetoclax resistance\". Then they test inhibitors. They find \"TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6+/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6\u2011/\u2011 cells\". Then \"Importantly, while TAG and GES impaired growth of primary human AML cells ... they did not impact normal human CD34+ HSPC colony growth\". Then \"SLC6A6 knockdown ... significantly impaired taurine uptake... as well as the colony-forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines\". Then \"SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells ... but did not significantly impair engraftment of normal human CD34+ HSPCs\". Then concluding sentence: \"Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\"\n\nThus interpretation: \"Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\"\n\nPremise: \"SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2\u2011 to 40\u2011fold in patient\u2011derived xenograft models (Fig. 4k,l)\" (or the colony assays). Choose one explicit premise. For simplicity: \"SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2\u2011 to 40\u2011fold in patient\u2011derived xenograft models\". Connecting principle: Not explicit; could be \"SLC6A6 encodes the taurine transporter (TAUT) and is required for taurine uptake\". Not stated explicitly here. So missing.\n\nThus we can capture triplet.\n\nPotential other interpretations: \"TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6+/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6\u2011/\u2011 cells.\" Interpretation: \"These data indicate that TAG and GES specifically target TAUT activity\". However they didn't explicitly state that as interpretation; they just present data.\n\nThus we include one triplet.\n\n#### Subsection: Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\n\nParagraph includes numerous data and concluding statements. At end: \"Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2013TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG\u2011mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\" That's interpretation. Premise: \"Untargeted metabolomics analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate... in Slc6a6\u2011/\u2011 cells\" (or \"TAUT loss results in a 2.2\u2011 to 3\u2011fold reduction in activated mTOR...\"). There are many premises. Also \"TAUT loss resulted in downregulation of glycolysis-associated genes\" etc.\n\nConnecting principle: The known link that \"mTOR signalling regulates glycolysis\" or \"RAG GTPases sense amino acid availability to activate mTORC1\". This is stated within the text: \"Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization... thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.\" That's a connecting principle; it's explicitly stated in the text (no external citation aside from references but it's a statement). That qualifies. So we have a linking principle.\n\nThus we have at least one triplet:\n\nPremise: \"TAUT loss results in a 2.2\u2011 to 3\u2011fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m)\". (Alternatively the metabolomics showing glycolysis downregulation.) But we need a premise that supports conclusion that taurine-TAUT axis regulates glycolysis via RAG-mTOR. The RNA-seq shows downregulated glycolysis genes, and phosphoproteomics shows reduced mTOR signalling. Choose one premise that is explicit.\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2013TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG\u2011mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.\" That is explicit.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nAlternatively there are also statements: \"TAUT loss leads to downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways... indicating that taurine may regulate energy metabolism.\" That includes a premise and interpretation (that taurine regulates energy metabolism) but connecting principle missing.\n\nWe can include a second triplet: Premise: \"Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites...\". Interpretation: \"These data suggest that taurine may regulate energy metabolism.\" But the connecting principle missing. Might be redundant.\n\nBut we need at least one triplet.\n\nThus for this section, one triplet with connecting principle explicit.\n\n#### Subsection: TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis (we already handled). Possibly also find interpretation: \"TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability...\". But that's not interpretation.\n\nThey later also say: \"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT...\" as we captured.\n\nThus we treat that as interpretation.\n\n#### Subsection: TAUT is essential for human AML growth\n\nInterpretation captured.\n\n#### Subsection: Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\n\nInterpretation captured.\n\n#### Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n\nInterpretation captured.\n\nPotential nuance: There is also an interpretation in the \"Temporal changes\" subsection: \"Pathway analysis... indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression.\" captured as second triplet.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nWe need to ensure verbatim extraction includes correct punctuation and text exactly as appears.\n\nLet's copy exact sentences.\n\nWe'll go back to text:\n\nTemporal changes subsection:\n\n- Premise: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).\" Actually the parenthetical citation is there. We'll include the exact phrase.\n\nInterpretation: \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).\" It appears after a comma: \"... and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).\" So we can extract precisely.\n\nNow second triplet: Premise: \"gene\u2011expression\u2011based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo\u2011associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d).\" This includes the figure references.\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\" Actually that's the sentence: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\" We'll take exactly.\n\nNow Ligand\u2013receptor interactome:\n\nPremise: The description of four distinct patterns: \"We identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr, Cdo1, Apoe and Agt.\" Need verbatim. Sentence might be split. We'll capture the whole paragraph but need to include text exactly.\n\nInterpretation: \"Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\" That's the sentence.\n\nNow TME signals support leukaemogenesis:\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\" We'll locate that exact phrase: \"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs.\"\n\nPremise: We need a specific data statement. Could be \"Co\u2011culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony\u2011forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1\u2011fold lower than the controls) (Extended Data Fig. 4d\u2013f).\" We'll capture that exact sentence.\n\nConnecting principle: Not present; missing.\n\nNow TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis:\n\nInterpretation: \"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self\u2011renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\"\n\nPremise: \"TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9\u2011fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d)\". We'll capture the full sentence.\n\nConnecting principle: missing.\n\nNow TAUT is essential for human AML growth:\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\"\n\nPremise: \"SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2\u2011 to 40\u2011fold in patient\u2011derived xenograft models (Fig. 4k,l).\" We'll capture that.\n\nConnecting principle: missing.\n\nNow Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia:\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2011TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG\u2011mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\"\n\nPremise: \"TAUT loss resulted in a 2.2\u2011 to 3\u2011fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m).\" Or \"Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate, glyceraldehyde\u20113\u2011phosphate and 3\u2011phosphoglycerate in Slc6a6\u2011/\u2011 cells, suggesting that taurine may regulate energy metabolism (Fig. 5a\u2013c).\" Choose whichever; the more explicit linking to metabolism and mTOR. For the purpose of connecting principle, we need the principle statement. The principle statement is: \"Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.\" That is present in the text. We'll use that as connecting principle.\n\nThus premise: \"TAUT loss resulted in a 2.2\u2011 to 3\u2011fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m).\"\n\nInterpretation as above.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.\"\n\nNow check if any other subsections have additional arguments.\n\nPotential additional argument in \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\": They also state \"TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin+ differentiated cells ... and promoted cell proliferation.\" But there may be an interpretation: \"TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin+ differentiated cells, and promoted cell proliferation.\" This could be considered an interpretation that TAUT loss drives necrosis and proliferation. But we have one triplet enough.\n\nNow also \"TAUT loss impairs normal haematopoiesis\"? Not sure.\n\nIn \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\" they also discuss normal haematopoiesis: \"TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity... but impacts long-term HSC self-renewal\". Interpretation: \"TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, but can impact long-term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" That's an interpretation.\n\nPremise: \"TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady\u2011state (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013e).\" That's a premise.\n\nConnecting principle: They compare to previous studies: \"These results are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC\u2011enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self\u2011renewal.\" That's a connecting principle. It's an explicit statement linking known function of similar genes to HSC self-renewal. So we could create a third triplet.\n\nBut is it part of the results? It's in discussion of results but it's present in the text. The connecting principle includes citations and known info. So we could include this.\n\nThe sentence: \"These results are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC\u2011enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self\u2011renewal.\" That's a connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: \"TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, but can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" Actually the sentence: \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\"\n\nWe need the exact phrasing: \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" The text says: \"While TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity... these results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance.\" Let's locate exact. The text: \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" Possibly something like that. We'll check the excerpt.\n\nFrom the text: \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" It appears near the end of the paragraph \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" Actually the text says: \"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" There may be a missing \"These results suggest that\".\n\nThe final sentences: \"These results are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC\u2011enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self\u2011renewal.\"\n\nThe interpretation is: \"These results suggest that ... TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis but can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\" That's not directly a single sentence but we can capture. The interpretation appears earlier: \"TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity... suggests that while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance.\" Let's locate exact.\n\nScrolling: In the paragraph:\n\n\"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance.\"\n\nThus we can capture that.\n\nThus we can include this triplet.\n\nThus we may have three triplets for this subsection.\n\nNow check \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\" also includes the conclusion that TAUT loss impairs initiation, self\u2011renewal and propagation, which we already captured.\n\nNow \"TAUT is essential for human AML growth\": The text also includes: \"Blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\" That's part of same interpretation. Good.\n\nNow \"Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\": The connecting principle is explicitly mentioned. So we have that.\n\nNow \"Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\" connecting principle missing. Good.\n\nNow \"Temporal changes\" we have two triplets.\n\nNow produce JSON array.\n\nMake sure to include \"subsection\" names exactly as header names in the text, including the \"Subsection:\" part? The header lines in the excerpt: \"### Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\". So the name is \"Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\". We'll use that.\n\nSimilarly: \"Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\", \"TME signals support leukaemogenesis\", \"TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\", \"TAUT is essential for human AML growth\", \"Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\".\n\nNow fill out each object's triplets.\n\nWe need to ensure each string is verbatim exactly as in the article, includes all punctuation.\n\nCheck each phrase.\n\nLet's capture precise text.\n\nFrom excerpt:\n\nTemporal changes paragraph:\n\nSentence for premise: \"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).\"\n\nInterpretation part: The clause after comma is the \"indicating that\". Actually the interpretation is that clause. Might need to extract \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\". We'll include the entire phrase after comma.\n\nThus Premise ends before comma; Interpretation includes after. The phrase \"indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression\" plus maybe \"(Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a)\". We'll include that.\n\nNow second premise: \"gene\u2011expression\u2011based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo\u2011associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d).\" Interpret.\n\nInterpretation: \"Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\"\n\nNow \"Ligand\u2013receptor interactome\" premise and interpretation.\n\nPremise: Let's capture the whole paragraph that describes the four patterns. The text:\n\n\"We identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point.

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified (Ref: 1\u20135), concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies (Ref: 6) to identify LSC\u2013niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine\u2013taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)-driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours (Ref: 1\u20135,7\u201310). While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours (Ref: 11,12), concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest. Aggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blast-crisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche (Ref: 13\u201315), their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in vivo leukaemia progression (Ref: 6). This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT\u2013KITL and CD47\u2013thrombospondin 1 (Ref: 16), as well as multiple new signalling axes. Of these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6, was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy (Ref: 17) or support anti-cancer immunity (Ref: 18), a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n\nTo define temporal changes in non-immune bone marrow microenvironment populations during myeloid leukaemia progression, we used bcCML LSCs, which can grow in unirradiated mouse recipients (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Bone marrow stromal populations (leukaemia\u207bCD45\u207bTER119\u207b) were isolated from leukaemic cohorts at distinct stages of disease progression and analysed using scRNA-seq (Fig. 1a). Gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and osteo-associated populations (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig. 1c,d). Our flow-cytometry-based analyses of an independent cohort of leukaemic mice validated these changes, showing increases in MSCs, osteolineage and arteriolar endothelial cells, with a concomitant decline in sinusoidal endothelial populations (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Clustering analyses of genes expressed in major lineages identified gene sets with similar changes in expression (Extended Data Fig. 1f), suggesting that these may represent altered stromal cell fate. Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\n\n> Fig. 1 | Temporal scRNA-seq analysis of myeloid leukaemia bone marrow microenvironment. a, The experimental strategy used to determine the impact of bcCML progression on bone-marrow microenvironment remodelling. b, A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of 15,695 non-haematopoietic cells from bone and bone marrow shows 21 distinct bone marrow stromal cell clusters (n = 3 (naive), n = 6 (initiation), n = 7 (expansion) and n = 9 (end) mice).

To identify LSC receptors associated with disease progression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of human AML and bcCML CD34\u207a cells, and healthy donor bone marrow CD34\u207a haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; Extended Data Fig. 2b). We noted significant (adjusted P (Padj) < 0.05) upregulation of 1,569 genes in bcCML, 2,842 genes in AML and 2,331 genes in both bcCML and AML compared with normal HSPCs. To identify signals that are functionally relevant for disease progression, we found cell surface genes (Ref: 19) that drop out by twofold or more in our genome-wide in vivo leukaemia CRISPR screen (Ref: 6). This identified 13 cell surface signals common to both bcCML and AML, 18 unique to AML and 7 unique to bcCML. Of these 38 genes, 16 were misannotated as cell surface in the reference dataset (Ref: 19) and were removed from further analysis (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). We used NicheNet and the published literature to identify ligands for these receptors, especially those that were significantly upregulated in our TME scRNA-seq data and in the human AML immune microenvironment (Ref: 20) (Extended Data Fig. 2e). This led to the exclusion of receptors with no known ligands (MR1, TMCO3 and TSPAN15) as well as those of which the ligands were not significantly enriched in any TME population (LGALS3BP, CD96, CD274 and CD3D). We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig. 2a). We next determined whether disease progression could alter the expression of LSC-specific TME ligands, and identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1, Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr, Cdo1, Apoe and Agt (Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013d). Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\n\n### Subsection: TME signals support leukaemogenesis\n\nMultiple TME\u2013LSC signalling axes identified in our interactome may have a functional role in leukaemia progression. However, we were interested in genes associated with unfavourable outcomes in human patients with AML. Of the 22 genes upregulated in human LSCs, only low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and SLC6A6 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML (Fig. 2a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). We therefore tested the functional requirement of TME-derived ligands of LDLR and SLC6A6 on LSC growth. One of the primary LDLR ligands, apolipoprotein E (APOE) (Ref: 21), was highly expressed in MSCs (Extended Data Fig. 3d). To test the role of APOE from MSCs on LSC function, we co-cultured bcCML LSCs with MSCs transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apoe or LacZ (control; Extended Data Fig. 4c). Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls; Extended Data Fig. 4d\u2013f). SLC6A6 encodes TAUT, which has high affinity for the non-essential amino acid taurine, and low affinity for \u03b2-alanine (taurine Km = 4.5 \u03bcM versus \u03b2-alanine Km = 56 \u03bcM) (Ref: 22). Our experiments indicate that Slc6a6 expression can be directly induced by oncogenes (Extended Data Fig. 4g). While the leukaemia TME did not express enzymes required for \u03b2-alanine synthesis (Gadl1 and Cndp1), those needed for taurine biosynthesis were expressed in osteo-associated cells (Cdo1 and Csad; Extended Data Fig. 4h,i). Our analysis of publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients (Ref: 23) showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig. 4j). To test whether CDO1 is expressed in the human leukaemia TME, we performed an scRNA-seq analysis of CD45\u207b stromal cells from three myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML bone marrow aspirates. Our analysis of the limited numbers of stromal cells in these samples indicate that CDO1 expression is restricted to the MSC/osteolineage cells (Extended Data Fig. 4k,l), as we see in mouse samples. Notably, we found a marked increase in CDO1 protein expression in nearly all matched biopsies of patients who progressed from MDS to secondary AML, and those who relapsed after AML diagnosis (Fig. 2d\u2013g and Extended Data Fig. 4m\u2013p). While CDO1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated human AML MSCs, its expression increased during in vitro mouse and human AML MSC osteogenic differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013c). Thus, CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow. Importantly, taurine levels in extracellular medium increased during MSC differentiation, indicating that elevated CDO1 expression is correlated with taurine production (Extended Data Fig. 5d). To determine a functional role of taurine from osteolineage cells, we tested the impact of inhibiting taurine biosynthesis in mouse and human leukaemia bone-marrow-derived MSCs on co-cultured leukaemia cells. Our experiments showed that mouse LSCs co-cultured with osteolineage cells lacking Cdo1 expression were significantly less viable (about 2-fold lower than the controls) and formed fewer colonies (3.4-fold less than controls), which could be rescued by supplementing cultures with taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5e\u2013g). Similarly, inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5h), indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival. Consistent with a functional role of taurine from the TME in leukaemia progression, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig. 2j). In mice, the majority of taurine is synthesized in the liver from cysteine (Ref: 24). To determine whether taurine produced locally in the bone marrow niche is essential for leukaemia growth, we generated a new Cdo1fl/fl mouse model and crossed it to MSC/osteolineage-specific Prrx1-cre mice (Extended Data Fig. 5i\u2013k). We used these as recipients for LSCs and monitored survival, and the impact on bone marrow microenvironment populations. Our experiments showed that Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre\u207a mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls, indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression, at least in part (Fig. 2k). We did not find any significant changes in the composition of TME in Cdo1fl/flPrrx1-cre\u207a leukaemic mice as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 5l\u2013n), suggesting that leukaemia-driven remodelling of the bone marrow niche does not depend on taurine produced by osteolineage cells. We finally tested whether exogenous taurine supplements can promote leukaemia growth. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of mouse LSCs and patient-derived AML cells increased by 1.2- to 3.3-fold in the presence of taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5o\u2013q). Taurine supplements could significantly accelerate disease progression in immunocompetent mice (around threefold higher likelihood of death relative to the controls; Extended Data Fig. 5r), indicating that taurine can promote leukaemic progression. Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs. As SLC6A6 expression was significantly enriched in both human bcCML and AML LSCs as compared to the controls, we focused our studies on SLC6A6, as it may be broadly required for growth of aggressive leukaemias.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Bone marrow microenvironmental ligands for LSC-specific cell surface receptors. a, Circos plot showing leukaemia cell surface receptors and cognate stromal-cell-derived ligands. b, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of human patients with leukaemia with low (<11.14, n = 80) or high (\u226511.14, n = 81) SLC6A6 expression (TCGA-LAML; Xena Browser; log-rank test).

While Slc6a6-knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios, they can develop ageing-related defects in bone mass and retinal degeneration (Ref: 25\u201327). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche. TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig. 6b). TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability (Fig. 3e), as well as a marked increase in the survival of mice transplanted with Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs (40%) relative to control LSCs (0%) in secondary transplant assays (21.2-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3f). The 8.5-fold reduction in colony-forming ability of bcCML LSCs from secondary transplants suggests that these leukaemias remain dependent on TAUT expression and taurine uptake for their continued propagation (Fig. 3g,h). We noted no significant differences in bone marrow microenvironmental populations of mice bearing Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b leukaemias as compared to the controls, indicating that leukaemia-driven niche remodelling possibly reflects the extent of the tumour burden, and may be independent of taurine levels within leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013g). To determine whether TAUT is broadly required for de novo AML growth, we tested the impact of its loss on initiation of leukaemia driven by MLL-AF9/NRAS(G12V) and by AML-ETO9a/NRAS(G12V). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3i\u2013k). Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b KIT\u207a AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig. 3l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs. Consistent with a key role of TAUT expression in myeloid leukaemia initiation, TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3m,n). At the cellular level, TAUT loss led to a 2.4- to 3.6-fold reduction in primitive Lin\u207bCD150\u207bFLT3\u207aSCA1\u207a LSCs (Ref: 6) (Fig. 3o). Furthermore, TAUT loss increased necrosis and the Lin\u207a differentiated cells (Fig. 3p and Extended Data Fig. 6h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig. 3q). These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia. We next tested the impact of TAUT loss on normal haematopoiesis. Our analysis indicates that TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady-state (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013e). While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). Although overall bone marrow chimerism 4 months after transplant was 2.4-fold lower in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b HSC recipients as compared to Slc6a6+/+ HSC recipients, these Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b HSCs were able to contribute to all haematopoietic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 7h\u2013k). Serial transplantation of Slc6a6+/+ and Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b bone marrow cells showed a similar loss in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b engraftment over time (Extended Data Fig. 7l\u2013q). These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC-enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self-renewal. However, therapeutic inhibition of CD98 showed minimal toxicity in AML phase I trials (Ref: 1) and BCL2 inhibitors are approved for AML therapy. It is therefore possible that non-genetic approaches using small-molecule inhibitors or gene silencing may identify a therapeutic window for TAUT targeting in human cells. We therefore tested the impact of TAUT inhibition on growth and proliferation of normal human HSPCs as well as patient-derived AML cells.\n\n> Fig. 3 | TAUT loss impairs myeloid leukaemia initiation and propagation in mouse models. a, Relative Slc6a6 mRNA expression in whole bone marrow cells from Slc6a6+/+ (+/+) and Slc6a6\u2212/\u2212 (\u2212/\u2212) mice.

While SLC6A6 is broadly expressed in AML irrespective of karyotype or FAB subtype (TCGA; Extended Data Fig. 8b), increased expression correlates with venetoclax resistance (BEAT-AML; Fig. 4a). SLC6A6 expression is also enriched in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-low LSCs from human monocytic AMLs (subtype clinically associated with venetoclax resistance; CD45brightSSChighCD117\u207bCD11b\u207aCD68\u207a) compared with primitive AML (Fig. 4b; CD45medSSClowCD117\u207aCD11b\u207bCD68\u207b) (Ref: 32). We find increased SLC6A6 expression in leukaemia cells carrying RAS mutations as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with data correlating RAS mutations with venetoclax resistance (Ref: 33) (Fig. 4c). SLC6A6 is also highly expressed in relapsed AML originating from stem/progenitor like cells compared with more committed populations (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 8c). These data collectively indicate that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance. To determine whether small-molecule inhibitors of TAUT can effectively block leukaemia growth, we used two well-characterized structural analogues of taurine that inhibit uptake: 6-aminomethyl-3-methyl-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide hydrochloride (Ref: 35) (TAG) and guanidinoethyl sulphonate (Ref: 36) (GES; Extended Data Fig. 8d,e). TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6+/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f\u2013h). Importantly, while TAG and GES impaired growth of primary human AML cells in colony assays by 1.8- to 20-fold, they did not impact normal human CD34\u207a HSPC colony growth (Fig. 4d,e). We next tested whether venetoclax can exacerbate the impact of TAUT loss and/or inhibition on LSC function. Our experiments showed that venetoclax reduced the viability of mouse Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs by 3.2-fold and lowered their colony formation by 13.2-fold as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8i,j). While TAG, GES or venetoclax alone could impair mouse LSC colony formation by 1.4- to 3.9-fold, their combination was synergistic and led to 2.3- to 7.2-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8k\u2013m). While primary human AML cells that were treated with GES, TAG or venetoclax alone formed 1.3- to 8.3-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls, combining the treatments substantially impaired colony formation by 2.4- to 150-fold. These data indicate that taurine inhibitors can synergize with venetoclax in blocking the growth of human AML cells (Fig. 4f\u2013h). As TAG and GES did not effectively block taurine uptake in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013j), we used shRNA-based approaches to determine the impact of inhibiting TAUT expression on human AML growth. Knocking down SLC6A6 expression using two independent shRNAs significantly impaired taurine uptake by 2.2 to 3.4-fold, as well as the colony-forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines by 2- to 12-fold (Extended Data Fig. 9k\u2013p). Our experiments showed that SLC6A6 knockdown in samples from patients with AML reduced their colony-forming ability by 2.33- to 9.12-fold as compared to the controls (Fig. 4i). By contrast, SLC6A6 knockdown did not impact colonies formed by normal human CD34\u207a HSPCs (Fig. 4j). Importantly, while SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2- to 40-fold in patient-derived xenograft models (Fig. 4k,l), it did not significantly impair engraftment of normal human CD34\u207a HSPCs in xenograft models (Fig. 4m). Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\n\n> Fig. 4 | TAUT inhibition impairs growth of patient-derived AML cells. a, SLC6A6 expression based on venetoclax (Ven) response (BEAT-AML). n = 193; dot plots show individual patients.

Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells, suggesting that taurine may regulate energy metabolism (Fig. 5a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 10a). Consistent with this, we noted a 1.3- to 1.8-fold reduction in basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs as compared to the controls (Fig. 5d,e and Extended Data Fig. 10b). To functionally test the role of glycolysis and TCA associated metabolites, we determined whether bypassing these could rescue Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b defects. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs could be significantly rescued by pyruvate, sodium acetate and lactate, but not glucagon (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10c\u2013e). These data suggest that glycolysis, and not gluconeogenesis, is the primary downstream effector of taurine in leukaemia cells. We next tested whether taurine contributed to any cellular metabolite by determining 13C-taurine incorporation in K562 leukaemia cells. Our untargeted metabolomic approach identified 13C label only in known taurine conjugates, N-acetyl taurine and glutaurine (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Membrane-permeable taurine fully rescued colonies formed by Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells (Fig. 5g), and N-acetyl-taurine partly rescued this defect (Extended Data Fig. 10h), perhaps by breakdown to taurine and acetate (Ref: 37). By contrast, glutaurine was unable to rescue the Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b colony formation (Extended Data Fig. 10i). These experiments indicate that taurine, and not a secondary metabolite, promotes leukaemia growth due to an indirect effect on glycolysis, possibly through downstream signalling. To identify signals downstream of taurine, we performed RNA-seq as well as phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses of primary mouse leukaemia cells (Fig. 5h). Our RNA-seq analysis identified 932 downregulated and 1,158 upregulated genes in the absence of TAUT (Padj < 0.05). The 1,158 upregulated genes included pathways associated with haematopoietic cell lineage and cell cycle regulation (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). The 932 downregulated genes primarily constituted pathways associated with glycolysis (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 11b\u2013d), consistent with reduced abundance of glycolysis associated metabolites in these cells (Fig. 5c). To determine effectors of glycolytic downregulation on TAUT loss, we performed gene set enrichment analysis. This identified profound downregulation of oncogenic MYC and mTOR pathways (Fig. 5j and Extended Data Fig. 11c). As mTOR signalling is known to regulate expression of glycolysis related genes (Ref: 38), we tested whether TAUT loss impairs mTOR activation. Western blot analysis showed that TAUT loss results in a 2.2- to 3-fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m and Extended Data Fig. 11e). Our global phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses also showed reduced expression of phosphorylated proteins associated with mTOR signalling, as well as 3.3-fold reduced BCL2 and 1.5-fold increased LC3A expression in the absence of TAUT (Extended Data Fig. 11f,g). Like TAUT loss, TAUT inhibition with TAG and GES downregulated glycolysis-related gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i) and impaired phosphorylation of mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Consistent with a direct impact of taurine on mTOR signalling, acute treatment in vitro and long-term taurine dosing in vivo could activate mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig. 12c\u2013h). Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin impaired the growth of wild-type cells but did not impact Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells in vitro or in vivo (Fig. 5n and Extended Data Fig. 12i,k). By contrast, mTOR activation with MHY1485 (Ref: 39) rescued the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b LSCs to 60% of the control, and membrane-permeable taurine rescued mTOR activation (Fig. 5o and Extended Data Fig. 12j\u2013l). Collectively, these data indicate that mTOR signalling has a key role downstream of taurine in leukaemia cells. Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation. We hypothesized that taurine may activate mTOR by promoting its interaction with RAG GTPases. To test this, we determined the effect of expressing constitutively active RAGA(Q66L) or RHEB(Q64L) on the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 wild-type and null cells. Our experiments showed that, while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5p). Furthermore, mTOR phosphorylation in Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells could be rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Extended Data Fig. 12m). Finally, we directly tested whether taurine could promote mTOR interactions with lysosomes in wild-type and Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b leukaemia cells expressing RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5q). Our immunofluorescence-based analysis showed that, at the baseline, Slc6a6\u207b/\u207b cells have 1.2-fold lower mTOR\u2013LAMP1 interaction, which could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L). Taurine supplements increased mTOR\u2013LAMP1 co-localization to levels seen in cells expressing RAGA(Q66L). However, this interaction could not be increased further by adding taurine to RAGA(Q66L)-expressing cells (Fig. 5r,s), consistent with our colony-forming assays (Extended Data Fig. 12n). Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2013TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG-mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\n\n> Fig. 5 | TAUT loss impairs glycolysis and mTOR signalling in myeloid leukaemia cells. a, The untargeted metabolomics strategy. b, Unbiased Enrichr analysis (MetaboAnalyst; Padj \u2264 0.05).

{"request_id": 6, "reasoning": "We need to analyze the provided excerpt. The task: identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case. The three parts: Premise (what we found), Connecting principle (pre-existing knowledge), Interpretation (what it means). The analysis should be done for each subsection in the Results section. Subsections are:\n\n- Subsection: Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCS\n- Subsection: Dependency on mitochondrial respiration\n- Subsection: Metformin suppresses Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS\n- Subsection: Metformin increases methylation capacity\n- Subsection: Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\n- Subsection: Metformin suppresses human mutant HSPCs\n\nWe need to extract triplets for each subsection: premise_finding, connecting_principle, interpretation.\n\nWe must identify each logical argument that follows that three-part structure. Possibly multiple triplets per subsection. We need to systematically go through and find each explicit interpretation statements, and then the premise and connecting principle that lead to it.\n\nWe must ensure that we capture the text verbatim.\n\nWe must also note implicit missing components as \"(missing)\". However guidelines say we need to mark \"(missing)\" when not explicitly present. Also for missing connecting principle, we could mark \"(missing)\". For implicit, maybe we use \"(missing)\"? The instructions say: \"If a component is not explicitly stated... mark that specific component as `(missing)`.\" So we use \"(missing)\". Not \"(implicit)\". The earlier part says \"If ... mark this component as `(missing)`.\" Actually the instruction says: \"If a component (Premise or Connecting Principle) is not explicitly stated in the text\u2014whether it is understood from context, implied, or simply missing\u2014mark that specific component as `(missing)`.\" So we use \"(missing)\". So we need to check each triplet: ensure all three components are present or missing.\n\nThe interpretation must be explicit. So we need to locate each interpretation statement. Then the premise and connecting principle around it.\n\nLet's start with the first subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCS\n\nWe need to find statements where authors present a hypothesis or claim based on data.\n\nReading that subsection:\n\n\"Analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from primary AML samples revealed an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in DNMT3A R882-mutated patient samples, but not in non-R882DNMT3A-mutated samples, compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To validate this finding in the context of clonal haematopoiesis, we analysed a previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of CD34+-enriched HSPCs from individuals with clonal haematopoiesis (Ref: 17). Pseudobulk differential expression analysis also showed an increase in OXPHOS gene expression in DNMT3A R882-mutated cells relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function between Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ mouse HSPCs. We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells, which are enriched for HSPCs, possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, as determined by extracellular flux analysis (Fig. 1a). These differences were also observed in unfractionated whole bone marrow (WBM) cells, albeit by a smaller magnitude (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c). Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\"\n\nThe last sentence: \"Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\" That's an interpretation. There's premise: the data about higher OCR, ROS, TM potential. The connecting principle: maybe the idea that increased OCR indicates metabolic reprogramming and OXPHOS upregulation. But is there any explicit separate statement? The connecting principle might be the known fact that OXPHOS gene expression indicates mitochondrial respiration; but that is implicit. The text does not contain a separate statement of connecting principle. It might be considered background: \"OXPHOS gene expression indicates mitochondrial respiration\". However the text does not have such a statement. In that case the connecting principle is missing? Let's read again: \"These findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function... We found that ... possessed higher levels of basal and maximal OCRs... the level of mitochondrial ROS... the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential to mitochondrial mass were higher... Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\" The interpretation: \"the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming... resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\" The premise is the set of observations: increased OCR, ROS, TM potential. The connecting principle is maybe \"Increased OCR and ROS reflect upregulation of OXPHOS.\" That is not explicitly stated. So we mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\". The premise must be verbatim text: \"We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells... possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells... the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c).\" That's long but we may capture the core. We should extract exact verbatim text. We need to include the whole premise statement where they describe that. Let's capture two sentences: \"We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells, which are enriched for HSPCs, possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, as determined by extracellular flux analysis (Fig. 1a).\" and \"Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c).\" We can combine.\n\nInterpretation: \"Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\"\n\nThus that is one triplet.\n\nNow we need find any other logical argument in this subsection. At the beginning, they mention analysis of publicly available RNA-seq showing increased OXPHOS gene expression in patient samples. The interpretation of that might be they conclude that DNMT3A R882 mutants have increased OXPHOS expression. Let's see: \"Analysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from primary AML samples revealed an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in DNMT3A R882-mutated patient samples, but not in non-R882DNMT3A-mutated samples, compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples (Extended Data Fig. 1a).\" That's premise. Then \"To validate this finding... Pseudobulk differential expression analysis also showed an increase in OXPHOS gene expression in DNMT3A R882-mutated cells relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b).\" That's further premise. The connecting principle might be \"Increased OXPHOS gene expression suggests increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity.\" The interpretation? Not explicitly. But they might have an interpretation: \"These findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function...\". That is more a rationale, not a conclusion. The interpretation could be \"The Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming...\" but that is the same interpretation as above. The earlier part set up the hypothesis but not a direct interpretative conclusion.\n\nThus likely only one triplet per subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Dependency on mitochondrial respiration\n\nReading the text:\n\n\"We postulated that the increased mitochondrial respiration in Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs is required for their competitive advantage over wild-type cells. To test this, we first established an in vitro competition assay... A parallel competition assay between CD45.2+ Dnmt3a+/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells ... After the culture period, the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was consistently 20% to 30% higher... Using this assay, we studied the effect of genetic knockdown of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunits on the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by transducing the mixed CD45.2+ mutant-CD45.1+ wild-type population with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Ndufv1 and Cox15... Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts. To explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin... Consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin... suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells... This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1... Metformin treatment also selectively reduced the clonogenic potential... To determine whether the effect of metformin was relevant in vivo... Peripheral blood chimerism analysis showed a stable ratio... By contrast, the ratio ... steadily increased... Metformin decreased this competitive advantage... This effect was observed in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments... Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\"\n\nInterpretation statements: \n- \"Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\" That's an interpretation: they are dependent on increased OXPHOS.\n- \"Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\" That's a broader interpretation: inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy.\n\nPotential multiple triplet: one for shRNA knockdown results and one for metformin effect.\n\nAlso interpretation: \"Metformin suppressed the competitive advantage... This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition\" Actually that's a direct conclusion: metformin suppresses competitive advantage via complex I inhibition.\n\nAlso: \"Metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months.\" That's an interpretation.\n\nThus we can extract perhaps two triplets:\n\n1) The dependence of mutant HSPCs on OXPHOS: premise - shRNA knockdown reduces OCR and competitive advantage; connecting principle - OXPHOS is required for competitive advantage; interpretation: \"mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\"\n\nBut the connecting principle is knowledge that OXPHOS provides energy or competitive advantage? Might be missing.\n\nPotentially the authors interpret \"Downregulation ... reduced ... indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS.\" The connecting principle might be \"Mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) is necessary for HSPC competition.\" That's not explicitly stated. So maybe missing.\n\nAlternatively the connecting principle could be \"Inhibition of complex I reduces OXPHOS\". But they mention NDI1 rescue confirming that metformin effect is due to complex I inhibition. That is explicit.\n\nBut we need to identify the three-part logical argument for each interpretation.\n\nInterpretation 1: \"mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\"\n\nPremise: \"Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e).\" That's the premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Increased OXPHOS provides a competitive advantage to HSPCs.\" Not explicitly stated, but maybe inferred. But there might be a statement: \"These findings indicate that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete...\" The connecting principle is the statement that OXPHOS is needed for competitive advantage. That is inside the interpretation rather than separate. However the definition: connecting principle is \"a statement of pre-existing knowledge that acts as a logical bridge\". In the sentence, the phrase \"indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts\" includes both the conclusion and the reason. The connecting principle may be \"Increased OXPHOS underlies competitive advantage\", but it's part of the same sentence. Might be considered connecting principle, but it's not a separate statement. However they may present it as an inference.\n\nThus possibly we treat the connecting principle as part of the phrase \"indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\" But that is still interpretive.\n\nAlternatively we could treat the premise includes the downregulation results and the connecting principle is the known fact that OXPHOS provides energy needed for competition, but it's not explicit. So we mark connecting principle as \"(missing)\" or maybe \"(missing)\".\n\nInterpretation 2: \"Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\"\n\nPremise: The entire set of experiments showing metformin reduces competitive advantage: in vitro competition, rescue by NDI1, longitudinal in vivo competition. So we need to pick a premise sentence that describes result: \"Metformin treatment decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h).\" That's a premise. Or more specific: \"Metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h).\" Provide that.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration can suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\" That's the link, but may not be stated explicitly. There is talk: \"Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy.\" So connecting principle is missing? Possibly the connecting principle is the earlier statement that OXPHOS is required for competitive advantage, which they also used. But it's not explicit as a separate statement. Might be missing.\n\nInterpretation 3: \"Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of mutant cells... This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1... confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition.\" That's an interpretation: metformin effect is via complex I inhibition.\n\nPremise: \"Treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (50 \u00b5M) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f).\" Also \"This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1\". Accept that.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Complex I inhibition reduces OXPHOS.\" Not explicitly stated but known. There is a statement: \"Metformin, a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I.\" That is a known fact. Actually the phrase \"Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)\" appears earlier. That is a connecting principle: Metformin inhibits complex I. So we can use that.\n\nThus we can produce triplet for that.\n\nThus for this subsection we can output multiple triplets.\n\nBut we need to ensure minimal triplet count: maybe we can choose one or two logical arguments that are clearly three-part. The guidelines allow multiple.\n\nLet's outline potential triplets:\n\nTriplet A: Dependence on OXPHOS.\n\n- Premise: \"Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"(missing)\" unless we find a statement that \"Increased OXPHOS provides a competitive advantage to HSPCs.\" Not present. So mark \"(missing)\".\n- Interpretation: \"mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\"\n\nTriplet B: Metformin effect via complex I inhibition.\n\n- Premise: \"Treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (50 \u00b5M) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f).\"\n- Connecting principle: \"Metformin... is a pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18).\" This is explicit: \"Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)\" appears earlier. Provide exact text: \"Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)\". But need to find exact within the text: \"To explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)\u2014on Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs.\" So we can use that phrase as connecting principle.\n- Interpretation: \"This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition.\"\n\nTriplet C: Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration as a therapeutic strategy.\n\n- Premise: \"Metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h).\" Or \"Metformin treatment decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months.\"\n- Connecting principle: \"(missing)\" maybe the knowledge that inhibiting mitochondrial respiration can target clonal haematopoiesis. Not explicit. So missing.\n- Interpretation: \"Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\"\n\nThus three triplets.\n\nNow Subsection: Metformin suppresses Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS\n\nReading:\n\n\"Metformin suppressed the long-term competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ donor cells in vivo (Fig. 1h), reflective of an effect at the HSC level. To provide independent evidence for an effect at the HSC level and gain insights into the mechanism of action of metformin, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the untreated and metformin-treated recipients at the end of the 7-month treatment period (Fig. 1h). (description). A total of 22,407 cells from untreated control mice (n = 2) were sequenced, 84.6% of which were CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 2a). For comparison, a total of 23,818 cells from metformin-treated mice (n = 2) were sequenced, and the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was significantly less at 56.5% (P<0.0001by chi-square test) (Fig. 2a). To determine which HSPC subsets were affected, we annotated each cell... Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig. 2b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level. Flow cytometric analysis... showed a reduction in the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in immunophenotypically defined... HSCs and progenitor subsets (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). To corroborate these findings, we transplanted Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ donor WBM cells... Five weeks after transplantation, the recipients were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin for 1 month... In untreated mice, the number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and the proportion of HSCs in the Lin SCA-1+KIT+ (LSK) fraction were higher in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients compared with Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d,e). The expansion of mutant HSCs was associated with a trend towards a higher proportion of HSCs in active cycling based on Ki-67 staining (Fig. 2f). Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d-f). Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\"\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n- \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets ... consistent with its effect at the HSC level.\" That's an interpretation: metformin reduces mutant HSC proportion.\n\n- \"Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients.\" Interpretation: metformin normalizes mutant HSC expansion.\n\n- \"Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\" That's the final interpretation.\n\nPremise for each: scRNA-seq results showing reduced proportion of mutant cells; flow cytometry data showing reduced ratio; number of HSCs per femur decreased etc.\n\nConnecting principle: Possibly \"Reduction in proportion of mutant HSCs indicates suppression of competitive advantage\" - not sure if explicit. Or \"Metformin affects HSCs\".\n\nLet's identify one logical argument.\n\nInterpretation: \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig. 2b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level.\"\n\nPremise: \"A total of 22,407 cells from untreated control mice (n = 2) were sequenced, 84.6% of which were CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells...

That's the premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"A reduction in the proportion of mutant cells in HSC cluster indicates suppression of HSC competitive advantage.\" Not explicitly stated.\n\nThus connecting principle is missing.\n\nInterpretation: \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets, consistent with its effect at the HSC level.\"\n\nAlternatively there is a later interpretation: \"Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients.\" That's a conclusion that metformin normalizes mutant HSC expansion.\n\nPremise: \"In untreated mice, the number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and the proportion of HSCs in the LSK fraction were higher in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients compared with Dnmt3a+/+ recipients. Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients.\" The premise includes the data about numbers and proportions.\n\nConnecting principle: Perhaps \"If mutant HSCs have increased numbers and proportion, reducing these to wild-type levels indicates suppression of competitive advantage.\" Not explicit. So missing.\n\nInterpretation: \"Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\" That's overarching interpretation.\n\nPremise: \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio...; Metformin reduced all parameters...\". So we can combine that.\n\nConnecting principle: Possibly \"Reduction of mutant HSC numbers and proportion reflects suppression of competitive advantage.\" Not explicit.\n\nThus missing.\n\nThus we can produce one or two triplets.\n\nWe need to identify three-part arguments: interpretation, premise, connecting principle. But missing connecting principle is allowed.\n\nWe can produce two triplets in this subsection: one focusing on scRNA-seq reduction of mutant cells; another focusing on metformin normalizing HSC numbers.\n\nNow Subsection: Metformin increases methylation capacity\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the scRNA-seq data revealed an enrichment of genes associated with OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs relative to wild-type HSCs and a decrease in expression of these genes with metformin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). This unexpected result suggested that metformin could influence mitochondrial respiration not only through a direct inhibition of complex I but also through downregulation of OXPHOS-related genes. To further investigate its mechanism of action, we first studied the effect of in vivo metformin treatment on mitochondrial function of HSPCs. We performed extracellular flux analysis on freshly isolated LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Metformin treatment reduced the basal and maximal OCRs as well as the Am of Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells to levels similar to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). To uncover the effect of metformin on specific metabolic pathways, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the untreated and treated LK cells of both Dnmt3a genotypes. This analysis, which focused on metabolites that are central to energy and redox metabolism, detected 101 named metabolites, of which 8 were significantly increased in metformin-treated mutant LK cells compared with untreated mutant cells (Supplementary Table 1). Of note, 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites (L-cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig. 3a,b). Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels and the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the intracellular concentrations of SAM and SAH, which were below the detection threshold of the bulk metabolomic analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, the methylation index was higher in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig. 3c), indicative of an increase in their cellular methylation potential. The effect of metformin on methylation index was observed only in Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs and not in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Fig. 3c). To determine whether the metformin-induced changes in methylation index could be due to alterations in the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK-enriched cells that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). GSEA of the RNA-seq dataset showed that metformin treatment decreased the expression of genes associated with stemness and OXPHOS (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f), consistent with our earlier results. Notably, it also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in 1C metabolism in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells (Fig. 3d). To confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles (Shmt2, Mthfd2l, Shmt1, Mthfd1, Mthfr, Ahcy, Cbs and Bhmt) and found that metformin treatment increased their expression in Dnmt3aR878H/+LK cells (Fig. 3e). Although metformin also up-regulated expression of these genes in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, the magnitude of change was much smaller (Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism. On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of exogenous SAM and SAH on the competitive advantage of mutant LK cells using our in vitro assay (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The suppressive effect of SAM on Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs was maintained after downregulation of Dnmt3b expression (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c), suggesting that this effect was independent of DNMT3B activity. Increasing the concentration of folic acid in the culture medium, which augments the availability of 1C units for SAM synthesis, also reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Conversely, exogenous SAH, which lowers the methylation index, counteracted the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To confirm these findings, we inhibited SHMT2 and MAT2A as alternative approaches to lowering the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio. SHMT2 generates a 1C unit (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) that is necessary for SAM synthesis through the folate and methionine cycles, and MAT2A directly catalyses the synthesis of SAM from methionine (Fig. 3a). In line with our hypothesis, pharmacologic inhibition of SHMT with SHIN-1 (Ref: 23) or MAT2A with AG-270 (Ref: 24) rescued the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant HSPCS (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). The addition of exogenous SAM mitigated the rescue effect of SHIN-1 (Extended Data Fig. 5g), indicating that SHIN-1 acts by reducing SAM production. Genetic knockdown of Shmt2 expression also rendered Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs resistant to the suppressive effect of metformin (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\"\n\nInterpretations include:\n\n- \"These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism.\" That is an interpretation.\n\nPremise: The observations that metformin increased expression of 1C metabolism genes (RT-qPCR data), increased metabolites linked to 1C metabolism (mass spec), increased methylation index (SAM/SAH ratio). Also that GSEA showed enrichment of 1C metabolism genes.\n\nConnecting principle: \"One-carbon metabolism (methionine cycle) generates SAM, which determines methylation potential.\" This is explicit: \"Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest...\" Also \"SAM:SAH ratio is an indicator of cellular methylation potential.\" Already present: \"ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential.\" That's connecting principle.\n\nThus we have a three-part: premise (metabolomic data showing upregulation of 1C metabolism; increased SAM:SAH ratio; increased expression of 1C metabolism genes). Connecting principle (Methionine cycle generates SAM, SAM:SAH ratio indicates methylation potential). Interpretation (metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism).\n\nThus we can produce a triplet.\n\nAlso later interpretation: \"On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\" That's an interpretation (hypothesis). Premise: \"These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs...\" That is the premise leading to hypothesis statement. Connecting principle: \"Increasing methylation index reduces competitive advantage.\" But that principle is not explicit, but may be from known role of DNA methylation. Might be missing.\n\nBut the explicit interpretation is \"we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage ... by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\" That is a hypothesis. Premise: previous conclusion about methylation potential increase. Connecting principle: \"Higher methylation potential reduces competitive advantage.\" Not explicit. So missing.\n\nThus we can include a triplet for that.\n\nAlso later \"These findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\" That's a concluding interpretation. Premise: experiments showing exogenous SAM reduces advantage, SAH counters effect, SHIN-1 and AG-270 rescue effect, knockdown of Shmt2 renders resistance, etc. Connecting principle: \"Methylation index determines competitive advantage.\" Not explicit. So missing.\n\nThus the key triplet is the one about metformin increasing methylation capacity via 1C metabolism upregulation.\n\nThus maybe one main triplet here.\n\nNow Subsection: Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\n\nRead:\n\n\"The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref: 13,17). In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent (Ref: 13). We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that elimination of residual DNMT3A activity by inactivating the remaining wild-type Dnmt3a allele in mutant cells should render them resistant to the effect of metformin. To test this prediction, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells. The knockout efficiency was approximately 98%, indicative of biallelic inactivation in both cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Using our in vitro competition assay, we found that Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs, regardless of their initial Dnmt3a genotype (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Another prediction is that metformin treatment should increase the level of methylation at CpG sites that are differentially hypomethylated in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells. To test this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis of LK-enriched bone marrow cells from recipient mice that received Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ WBM cells from sex-matched littermate donors and were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The RRBS technique, which enriches for CpG-rich regions, was chosen because DNMT3A preferentially catalyses DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a+/+ (n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports (Ref: 13,17), the majority of the DMRs (n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples (Fig. 4a). In the comparison between metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 3) and untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) samples, we identified 3,285 DMRs, 1,923 (58.5%) of which were hypermethylated in the treated samples (Fig. 4a). We found 870 overlapping DMRs at the intersection between these two sets (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similar findings were observed in the subsets of DMRs associated with CpG islands and gene promoter regions (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To explore the potential effect of these changes in DNA methylation on gene expression, we conducted GSEA on genes ranked by differential promoter methylation and mRNA expression from our bulk RNA-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells, compared with Dnmt3a+/+ cells, exhibited decreased promoter methylation and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Re-analysis of a previously published combined transcriptome and methylome dataset of single progenitor cells from individuals with DNMT3A R882-mutated clonal haematopoiesis also revealed similar patterns in changes in the methylation and expression of genes associated with OXPHOS (Ref: 17) (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a+/+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Notably, metformin treatment reversed these aberrant changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In human clonal haematopoiesis, the DNMT3A R882 mutation has previously been reported to result in preferential DNA hypomethylation of targets of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Ref: 17), which catalyses the methylation of histone H3 K27 (H3K27). In addition, the Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Ref: 25), indicating its potential influence on another layer of epigenetic regulation. Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs. To test this, we performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This analysis revealed a reduction in H3K27me3 levels globally and in the regions surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples relative to the untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). Consistent with our hypothesis, metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). To confirm these findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured the amount of H3K27me3 by intracellular flow cytometry. Similar to the ChIP-seq results, we found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells had lower levels of H3K27me3 than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells and metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in mutant cells to levels resembling those of wild-type cells (Fig. 4e). Together, these findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\"\n\nInterpretations:\n\n- \"We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage.\" That's an interpretation, a hypothesis.\n\n- \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect.\" That's an interpretation (supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required).\n\n- \"In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs ... bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\" This is an interpretation confirming hypothesis.\n\n- \"We hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" That's hypothesis.\n\n- \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\" This is result; interpretation: \"metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape\".\n\n- \"These findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" That's the concluding interpretation.\n\nThus many possible triplets.\n\nWe need to extract each logical argument with premise, connecting principle, interpretation.\n\nLet's identify a main argument: Metformin reverses DNA hypomethylation.\n\nInterpretation: \"metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs... bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\" Actually that's a result. The interpretation is \"In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level...\". The interpretation is that metformin reverses DNA hypomethylation.\n\nPremise: The data: \"metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs... (Fig.4b).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"DNMT3A mutations lead to DNA hypomethylation due to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity.\" That's explicit: \"The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref: 13,17).\" That's the connecting principle.\n\nInterpretation: \"In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\" Actually that's partly premise; need interpretation separate. The interpretation might be: \"metformin reverses the aberrant DNA methylation pattern in mutant cells.\" The text: \"These findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" That's a concluding interpretation.\n\nThus we can extract two triplets: one for DNA methylation reversal; one for H3K27me3 reversal.\n\nFirst triplet: For DNA methylation.\n\nInterpretation: \"In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\"\n\nPremise: The data that metformin treatment increased methylation at those DMRs; perhaps also the RRBS identification of DMRs etc.\n\nConnecting principle: \"The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref: 13,17).\"\n\nThus we can pick exact phrasing for connecting principle.\n\nSecond triplet: For H3K27me3.\n\nInterpretation: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\" Or \"These findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" Also \"Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" Actually the interpretation is \"metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile.\"\n\nPremise: The data: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig.4c,d).\" Also \"H3K27me3 levels were reduced globally in untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples vs wild-type (Fig.4c,d).\" So premise includes those data.\n\nConnecting principle: \"PRC2-mediated methylation activity is regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio.\" This is explicit: \"Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio.\"\n\nThus we have a triplet.\n\nAlso there is an interpretation about residual DNMT3A activity required for metformin effect.\n\nInterpretation: \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect.\"\n\nPremise: \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout\". Also \"Dnmt3a knockout increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs... Metformin no longer suppressed.\" The premise statements are present.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Metformin's effect relies on DNMT3A activity for methylation.\" Not explicit. Possibly the connecting principle is that residual DNMT3A activity contributes to methylation; but not explicitly stated. So missing.\n\nThus we can add a triplet with missing connecting principle.\n\nAlso interpretation about hypothesis: \"We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage.\"\n\nInterpretation is the hypothesis. Premise is earlier statements about DNMT3A mutation leads to hypomethylation, metformin increases methylation index. But connecting principle: \"Increasing methylation index can augment residual DNMT3A activity.\"\n\nMaybe too many.\n\nBut the specification says \"identify instances of a specific three-part logical argument structure that authors use to build their case.\" So we need to capture each time they have an argument with premise, connecting principle, interpretation.\n\nThus we need to extract all such logical arguments in each subsection. There may be many. But we can limit to plausible ones; excessive might be overkill. We need to output a JSON array with each subsection and its triplets.\n\nWe need to be careful to follow the format exactly: list of objects with \"subsection\" and \"triplets\". Within each \"triplets\" array, each object includes \"premise_finding\", \"connecting_principle\", \"interpretation\".\n\nWe must not produce any extra explanation.\n\nNow let's systematically parse each subsection and extract relevant logical arguments.\n\nWe should go through each sub-section in order, scanning for interpretation statements. For each interpretation statement, identify preceding premise and connecting principle.\n\n### Subsection: Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCS\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n1) \"Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\"\n\nPremise: The observations: increased basal and maximal OCR, increased mitochondrial ROS, increased TM potential (Am/mitochondrial mass). The statements: \"We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells ... possessed higher levels of basal and maximal OCRs ... Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c).\" That's premise.\n\nConnecting principle: Not explicitly stated. Could be \"Higher OCR and ROS indicates metabolic reprogramming and upregulation of OXPHOS.\" Not present; so missing.\n\nThus triplet.\n\nPotential also another interpretation: \"The Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\" Already captured.\n\nThus just one triplet.\n\n### Subsection: Dependency on mitochondrial respiration\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\na) \"Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\"\n\nInterpretation: mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS.\n\nPremise: \"Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e).\"\n\nConnecting principle: Might be \"Increased OXPHOS provides a competitive advantage to HSPCs.\" Not explicitly stated, so missing.\n\nb) \"This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition.\"\n\nInterpretation: The effect of metformin is due to complex I inhibition.\n\nPremise: \"Metformin suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells ... This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Metformin is an inhibitor of complex I.\" That is explicit: \"Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18).\"\n\nThus we can use that as connecting principle.\n\nc) \"Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\"\n\nInterpretation: inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a therapeutic strategy.\n\nPremise: The data showing metformin reduces competitive advantage in vitro and in vivo over 7 months, rescue by NDI1, etc. Could use \"Metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h).\"\n\nConnecting principle: Not explicit; missing because they haven't stated why inhibiting respiration would be therapeutic. So missing.\n\nThus three triplets.\n\n### Subsection: Metformin suppresses Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\na) \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig. 2b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level.\"\n\nInterpretation: Metformin reduces mutant HSC proportion, effect at HSC level.\n\nPremise: The data: \"The proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was significantly less at 56.5% ... Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets.\" So we can capture one premise sentence: \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets.\"\n\nConnecting principle: Not explicit; missing.\n\nb) \"Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d-f).\"\n\nInterpretation: Metformin normalizes HSC numbers and proportions.\n\nPremise: The results: \"number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and proportion of HSCs in LSK fraction were higher in mutant recipients; metformin reduced these parameters.\" So premise: \"Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients.\"\n\nConnecting principle: Not explicit; missing.\n\nc) \"Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\"\n\nInterpretation: overall conclusion.\n\nPremise: The combined data: reduction in mutant cell ratio in scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, HSC numbers.\n\nBut we can use the statement itself as premise? Actually we need a premise that is data. Could choose \"the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster decreased\" as premise. But we already used that. Maybe choose \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio ... and HSC numbers\" as premise, but that may duplicate.\n\nNevertheless we can include a triplet with premise: \"Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets\" (or use the one from earlier). The connecting principle missing. The interpretation is the concluding statement.\n\nGiven that we already have a triplet for the reduction of ratio, maybe we can treat the concluding statement as a separate interpretation referencing the same premise but with missing connecting principle.\n\nWe could combine, but ensuring each triplet contains a distinct interpretation.\n\nThus output two triplets for this subsection.\n\n### Subsection: Metformin increases methylation capacity\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\na) \"These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism.\"\n\nInterpretation.\n\nPremise: Evidence: mass spec showing upregulated metabolites of 1C metabolism; increased SAM:SAH ratio; upregulation of 1C metabolism genes (RNA-seq, RT-qPCR). Provide a premise sentence: \"Metformin treatment increased the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles... (Fig. 3e).\" Also \"Mass spectrometry... 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites are involved in one\u2011carbon metabolism...\". Could use a compound premise: \"Four out of the eight up\u2011regulated metabolites (L\u2011cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one\u2011carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig.\u00a03a,b).\" and \"The methylation index was higher in metformin\u2011treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c).\" But we may just choose one premise.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, and the SAM:SAH ratio (methylation index) is an indicator of cellular methylation potential.\" This is explicitly stated: \"Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels... (and earlier \"the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential.\")\"\n\nThus we have a full triplet.\n\nb) \"On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\"\n\nInterpretation is a hypothesis.\n\nPremise: The preceding findings that metformin increases methylation potential, and evidence that methylation reduces competitive advantage (but may be implied). The premise could be the previous interpretation: \"These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs...\" but the premise must be direct data. So we could take the data about SAM:SAH ratio increase: \"The methylation index was higher in metformin\u2011treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig. 3c).\" Or \"Metformin treatment increased the expression of eight genes...\". Choose one.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Increasing methylation potential can suppress the competitive advantage of mutant HSCs.\" This is not explicitly stated; missing.\n\nThus we can have a triplet with missing connecting principle.\n\nc) \"Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\"\n\nInterpretation: concluding mechanism.\n\nPremise: Evidence from SAM, SAH, gene expression, metabolite changes, functional experiments (exogenous SAM reduces advantage, SAH counteracts). Use one premise: \"The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a).\" Or \"Pharmacologic inhibition of SHMT with SHIN-1 or MAT2A with AG-270 rescued the suppressive effect of metformin.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Increasing methylation index reduces competitive advantage.\" Missing.\n\nThus we may include this triplet.\n\nBut maybe we don't need too many; but will provide at least one.\n\n### Subsection: Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n1) \"We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage.\"\n\nInterpretation (hypothesis). Premise: The fact that DNMT3A mutation leads to DNA hypomethylation; Metformin increases methylation index (shown earlier). The connecting principle: \"Higher methylation index can augment DNMT3A activity leading to increased DNA methylation.\" Not explicit; missing.\n\nThus we can have a triplet with missing connecting principle.\n\n2) \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect.\"\n\nInterpretation: residual DNMT3A activity is required.\n\nPremise: \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout.\" Also earlier \"Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage\" etc.\n\nConnecting principle: \"Metformin effect depends on DNMT3A activity.\" Not explicit; missing.\n\n3) \"In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\"\n\nInterpretation: metformin reverses DNA hypomethylation.\n\nPremise: \"Metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 ...\". That's premise.\n\nConnecting principle: The mechanism linking DNMT3A mutation leading to hypomethylation and that methylation index increase can reverse this. Not explicit, but could be \"DNA methylation at CpG sites is mediated by DNMT3A activity.\" Not explicit; missing.\n\n4) \"Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\"\n\nInterpretation: hypothesis about H3K27.\n\nPremise: The prior info that PRC2-mediated methylation is regulated by SAM/SAH ratio is explicit; also the observation that Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells have reduced H3K27me3. So premise includes that data: \"metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels...\" but the hypothesis is prior to testing.\n\nThus we need a triplet for the hypothesis.\n\nPremise: \"The Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).\" Also \"Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio\". Those are premises.\n\nConnecting principle: \"PRC2-mediated methylation activity is regulated by the SAM/SAH ratio.\" That's explicit.\n\nInterpretation: \"we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\" That's the hypothesis.\n\nThus a triplet.\n\n5) \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\"\n\nInterpretation: metformin reverses H3K27me3 deficiency.\n\nPremise: The ChIP-seq data showing restoration. Sentence: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d).\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"PRC2-mediated methylation can be modulated by SAM/SAH ratio.\" Already present.\n\nThus we can have a triplet.\n\n6) \"These findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\"\n\nInterpretation: overall conclusion.\n\nPremise: The data of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 restoration.\n\nConnecting principle: Missing? Could be \"Reversing epigenetic abnormalities could suppress mutant clonal advantage\" not explicit; missing.\n\nThus we can include.\n\nBut may be too many; but they ask to identify instances of the three-part logical argument structure. So we may need to include multiple.\n\n### Subsection: Metformin suppresses human mutant HSPCs\n\nInterpretation statements:\n\n1) \"Metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A\u2011KD HSPCs.\" Actually the expression: \"Metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A\u2011KD HSPCs.\" That's an interpretation? It's a result. Might be \"Metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage\" is a conclusion about effect.\n\nInterpretation: \"Metformin reduces competitive advantage of DNMT3A\u2011KD HSPCs.\"\n\nPremise: Data: \"Metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A\u2011KD HSPCs (Fig. 5b).\" Also \"This effect was mitigated by the co\u2011expression of NDI1.\"\n\nConnecting principle: \"Metformin is a complex I inhibitor.\" That's explicit earlier: \"Metformin\u2014a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I.\" Also \"NDI1 is metformin-resistant yeast analogue of complex I.\" So connecting principle is explicit.\n\nThus triplet.\n\n2) \"Metformin treatment augmented the methylation index (Fig. 5f\u2026) and increased 5mC and H3K27me3 in DNMT3A\u2011KD cells (Fig. 5d,e), mirroring the mechanistic findings observed in mouse Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs.\" That's interpretation about the mechanism.\n\nInterpretation: Metformin increases methylation index and epigenetic marks in DNMT3A\u2011KD cells.\n\nPremise: The observed increase in SAM:SAH ratio (Fig.5f) and increased 5mC and H3K27me3 (Fig.5d,e).\n\nConnecting principle: \"Increased methylation index leads to increased DNA and histone methylation.\" Not explicitly stated but could be considered known.

The methylation index was higher in metformin\u2011treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c). Metformin treatment increased the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles (Fig.\u00a03e).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, and the ratio of SAM to SAH (the methylation index) is an indicator of cellular methylation potential.\"\n- interpretation: \"These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism.\"\n\nTriplet 2:\n\n- premise_finding: \"The methylation index was higher in metformin\u2011treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n- interpretation: \"On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\"\n\nTriplet 3:\n\n- premise_finding: \"The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data\u00a0Fig.\u00a05a).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n- interpretation: \"Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\"\n\n#### Subsection: Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\n\nTriplet 1:\n\n- premise_finding: \"The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref:\u00a013,\u202f17).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" Actually that's a statement about DNMT3A function; but the premise is that they have that knowledge.

The interpretation is the hypothesis: \"We hypothesized that the metformin\u2011induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage.\"\n\nThus we need to separate:\n\nInterpretation: \"We hypothesized that the metformin\u2011induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage.\"\n\nPremise: The prior knowledge about DNMT3A mutation leading to hypomethylation, and earlier data showing metformin increases methylation index. The premise is present as two sentences; we can capture one: \"The mechanism ... is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref:\u00a013,\u00a017).\" Also \"The methylation index was higher in metformin\u2011treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c).\" But the hypothesis statement is after these. So we can choose the first as premise.

In this case the statement includes both premise and interpretation. However they phrase \"Metformin did not suppress... supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required\". The part after \"supporting the idea that\" is the interpretation. So we need to separate.\n\nPremise: \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout.\"\n\nConnecting principle: The idea that metformin's effect depends on residual DNMT3A activity; not explicit.\n\nInterpretation: \"Residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect.\"\n\nThus we can separate.\n\nThus Triplet 2:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout.\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\"\n- interpretation: \"Residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect.\"\n\nTriplet 3:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04b).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" Perhaps could use \"DNA CpG methylation is mediated by DNMT3A activity\" not explicit.\n- interpretation: \"Metformin reverses the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells.\"\n\nTriplet 4:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Given that PRC2\u2011mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\"\n- connecting_principle: \"PRC2\u2011mediated methylation activity is regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio.\"\n- interpretation: \"We hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\"\n\nTriplet 5:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04c,d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"PRC2\u2011mediated methylation activity is regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio.\"\n- interpretation: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples.\"\n\nTriplet 6:\n\n- premise_finding: \"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04c,d).\"\n- connecting_principle: \"(missing)\" Actually we already used connecting principle for PRC2.

Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses (Ref: 1-4). Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot (Ref: 1-3,5-7). Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration (Ref: 8), reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers (Ref: 1-3,5,6). DNMT3A encodes a de novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) (Ref: 7,9). Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations (Ref: 10,11). Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention. The mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous (Ref: 12,13). DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner (Ref: 13,14). Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts (Ref: 13,15). The effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs (Ref: 16), thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between Dnmt3aR878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n## Results\n\n### Subsection: Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCS\n\nAnalysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from primary AML samples revealed an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in DNMT3A R882-mutated patient samples, but not in non-R882DNMT3A-mutated samples, compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To validate this finding in the context of clonal haematopoiesis, we analysed a previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of CD34+-enriched HSPCs from individuals with clonal haematopoiesis (Ref: 17). Pseudobulk differential expression analysis also showed an increase in OXPHOS gene expression in DNMT3A R882-mutated cells relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function between Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ mouse HSPCs. We found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells, which are enriched for HSPCs, possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, as determined by extracellular flux analysis (Fig. 1a). These differences were also observed in unfractionated whole bone marrow (WBM) cells, albeit by a smaller magnitude (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Am) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig. 1b,c). Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3qR878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\n\n> Fig.1|Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs are dependent on increased mitochondrial respiration. a, Basal (left) and maximal (middle) OCRs in LK HSPCs.

To test this, we first established an in vitro competition assay in which CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells were mixed at a ratio of approximately 2:3 and cultured in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium for around 10 days, followed by determination of the proportions of CD45.2* and CD45.1+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a). A parallel competition assay between CD45.2+ Dnmt3a+/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells mixed at the same starting ratio served as a control. After the culture period, the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was consistently 20% to 30% higher than that of CD45.2+ Dnmt3a+/+ cells in the first passage and 40% to 50% higher in the second passage (Extended Data Fig. 1e), demonstrating the competitive advantage of the mutant cells. Using this assay, we studied the effect of genetic knockdown of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunits on the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by transducing the mixed CD45.2+ mutant-CD45.1+ wild-type population with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Ndufv1 and Cox15 (Extended Data Fig. 2a), which encode critical subunits in complex I and complex IV of the ETC, respectively. Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 1d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts. To explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin-a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)-on Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs. Consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (Ref: 18) (50 \u00b5M) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f). This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, a metformin-resistant yeast analogue of complex I (Ref: 19,20), thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition (Fig. 1g). Metformin treatment also selectively reduced the clonogenic potential of Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCS over Dnmt3a+/+ LK HSPCs in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To determine whether the effect of metformin was relevant in vivo and over a longer treatment period, we conducted a competitive repopulation experiment by mixing CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ WBM cells with CD45.1+ Dnmt3a++ WBM cells at a 2:3 ratio and transplanting the mixed cells into lethally irradiated recipients (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Five weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin in their drinking water at 5 mg ml\u00af\u00b9, a concentration that has previously been shown to result in blood concentrations similar to those achievable in humans (Ref: 21). Peripheral blood chimerism analysis showed a stable ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in mice that received CD45.2 Dnmt3a+/+ control cells, and the ratio was not affected by metformin treatment (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1b). By contrast, the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells steadily increased over a 7-month period in mice that received CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells, reflecting their competitive advantage over CD45.1+ wild-type cells (Fig. 1h). Notably, metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig. 1h). This effect was observed in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments (Extended Data Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n### Subsection: Metformin suppresses Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS\n\nMetformin suppressed the long-term competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ donor cells in vivo (Fig. 1h), reflective of an effect at the HSC level. To provide independent evidence for an effect at the HSC level and gain insights into the mechanism of action of metformin, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the untreated and metformin-treated recipients at the end of the 7-month treatment period (Fig. 1h). The cells were collected from the mice transplanted with CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ and CD45.1+ Dnmt3a+/+ competitor cells and stained with antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates specific for CD45.2 or CD45.1 to identify their donor origin. A total of 22,407 cells from untreated control mice (n = 2) were sequenced, 84.6% of which were CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells (Fig. 2a). For comparison, a total of 23,818 cells from metformin-treated mice (n = 2) were sequenced, and the proportion of CD45.2+ Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells was significantly less at 56.5% (P<0.0001by chi-square test) (Fig. 2a). To determine which HSPC subsets were affected, we annotated each cell on the basis of their correlation with reference mouse HSPC gene sets (Ref: 22) and identified 11 different haematopoietic subsets (Fig. 2a). Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig. 2b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow samples collected from mice after 4 months of treatment also showed a reduction in the ratio of CD45.2+ to CD45.1+ cells in immunophenotypically defined (Lin KIT+SCA-1+ CD150*CD48\u00af) HSCs and progenitor subsets (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). To corroborate these findings, we transplanted Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ donor WBM cells from sex-matched littermates in a non-competitive manner into lethally irradiated recipients. Five weeks after transplantation, the recipients were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). In untreated mice, the number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and the proportion of HSCs in the Lin SCA-1+KIT+ (LSK) fraction were higher in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients compared with Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d,e). The expansion of mutant HSCs was associated with a trend towards a higher proportion of HSCs in active cycling based on Ki-67 staining (Fig. 2f). Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3aR878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a+/+ recipients (Fig. 2d-f). Our findings demonstrate that metformin treatment suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCS.\n\n> Fig. 2 | Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. a, Top, dimensionality reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) on all sequenced cells (n = 46,225 cells).

This unexpected result suggested that metformin could influence mitochondrial respiration not only through a direct inhibition of complex I but also through downregulation of OXPHOS-related genes. To further investigate its mechanism of action, we first studied the effect of in vivo metformin treatment on mitochondrial function of HSPCs. We performed extracellular flux analysis on freshly isolated LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Metformin treatment reduced the basal and maximal OCRs as well as the Am of Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells to levels similar to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). To uncover the effect of metformin on specific metabolic pathways, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the untreated and treated LK cells of both Dnmt3a genotypes. This analysis, which focused on metabolites that are central to energy and redox metabolism, detected 101 named metabolites, of which 8 were significantly increased in metformin-treated mutant LK cells compared with untreated mutant cells (Supplementary Table 1). Of note, 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites (L-cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig. 3a,b). Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels and the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the intracellular concentrations of SAM and SAH, which were below the detection threshold of the bulk metabolomic analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, the methylation index was higher in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig. 3c), indicative of an increase in their cellular methylation potential. The effect of metformin on methylation index was observed only in Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK HSPCs and not in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells (Fig. 3c). To determine whether the metformin-induced changes in methylation index could be due to alterations in the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK-enriched cells that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). GSEA of the RNA-seq dataset showed that metformin treatment decreased the expression of genes associated with stemness and OXPHOS (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f), consistent with our earlier results. Notably, it also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in 1C metabolism in metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells (Fig. 3d). To confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles (Shmt2, Mthfd2l, Shmt1, Mthfd1, Mthfr, Ahcy, Cbs and Bhmt) and found that metformin treatment increased their expression in Dnmt3aR878H/+LK cells (Fig. 3e). Although metformin also up-regulated expression of these genes in Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells, the magnitude of change was much smaller (Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism. On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of exogenous SAM and SAH on the competitive advantage of mutant LK cells using our in vitro assay (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The suppressive effect of SAM on Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs was maintained after downregulation of Dnmt3b expression (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c), suggesting that this effect was independent of DNMT3B activity. Increasing the concentration of folic acid in the culture medium, which augments the availability of 1C units for SAM synthesis, also reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Conversely, exogenous SAH, which lowers the methylation index, counteracted the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To confirm these findings, we inhibited SHMT2 and MAT2A as alternative approaches to lowering the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio. SHMT2 generates a 1C unit (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) that is necessary for SAM synthesis through the folate and methionine cycles, and MAT2A directly catalyses the synthesis of SAM from methionine (Fig. 3a). In line with our hypothesis, pharmacologic inhibition of SHMT with SHIN-1 (Ref: 23) or MAT2A with AG-270 (Ref: 24) rescued the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant HSPCS (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). The addition of exogenous SAM mitigated the rescue effect of SHIN-1 (Extended Data Fig. 5g), indicating that SHIN-1 acts by reducing SAM production. Genetic knockdown of Shmt2 expression also rendered Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs resistant to the suppressive effect of metformin (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\n\n> Fig. 3 | Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs by enhancing their methylation potential. a, Schematic of the metabolic pathways involved in 1C metabolism.

In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent (Ref: 13). We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that elimination of residual DNMT3A activity by inactivating the remaining wild-type Dnmt3a allele in mutant cells should render them resistant to the effect of metformin. To test this prediction, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a+/+ and Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells. The knockout efficiency was approximately 98%, indicative of biallelic inactivation in both cell types (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Using our in vitro competition assay, we found that Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs, regardless of their initial Dnmt3a genotype (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Another prediction is that metformin treatment should increase the level of methylation at CpG sites that are differentially hypomethylated in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells. To test this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis of LK-enriched bone marrow cells from recipient mice that received Dnmt3aR878H/+ or Dnmt3a+/+ WBM cells from sex-matched littermate donors and were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The RRBS technique, which enriches for CpG-rich regions, was chosen because DNMT3A preferentially catalyses DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a+/+ (n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports (Ref: 13,17), the majority of the DMRs (n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples (Fig. 4a). In the comparison between metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 3) and untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) samples, we identified 3,285 DMRs, 1,923 (58.5%) of which were hypermethylated in the treated samples (Fig. 4a). We found 870 overlapping DMRs at the intersection between these two sets (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similar findings were observed in the subsets of DMRs associated with CpG islands and gene promoter regions (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). To explore the potential effect of these changes in DNA methylation on gene expression, we conducted GSEA on genes ranked by differential promoter methylation and mRNA expression from our bulk RNA-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells, compared with Dnmt3a+/+ cells, exhibited decreased promoter methylation and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Re-analysis of a previously published combined transcriptome and methylome dataset of single progenitor cells from individuals with DNMT3A R882-mutated clonal haematopoiesis also revealed similar patterns in changes in the methylation and expression of genes associated with OXPHOS (Ref: 17) (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3aR878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a+/+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Notably, metformin treatment reversed these aberrant changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in mutant cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In human clonal haematopoiesis, the DNMT3A R882 mutation has previously been reported to result in preferential DNA hypomethylation of targets of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Ref: 17), which catalyses the methylation of histone H3 K27 (H3K27). In addition, the Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Ref: 25), indicating its potential influence on another layer of epigenetic regulation. Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs. To test this, we performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This analysis revealed a reduction in H3K27me3 levels globally and in the regions surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples relative to the untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). Consistent with our hypothesis, metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). To confirm these findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured the amount of H3K27me3 by intracellular flow cytometry. Similar to the ChIP-seq results, we found that Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK cells had lower levels of H3K27me3 than Dnmt3a+/+ LK cells and metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in mutant cells to levels resembling those of wild-type cells (Fig. 4e). Together, the above findings demonstrate that metformin treatment can reverse the aberrant epigenetic landscape in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs.\n\n> Fig. 4 | Metformin reverses the aberrant epigenetic profiles in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs. a, Violin plots of the difference in beta values at all DMRs, CpG island-associated DMRs or promoter-associated DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples versus untreated Dnmt3a+/+ LK samples and between metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples versus untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ LK samples. n = 3 biologically independent samples for untreated Dnmt3a+/+ and metformin-treated Dnmt3aR878H/+. n = 4 biologically independent samples for metformin-treated Dnmt3a+/+ and untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples.

Since DNMT3A R882-mutated cells retain about 20% of wild-type DNMT3A activity (Ref: 13), knockdown of DNMT3A expression should phenocopy the effects of DNMT3A R882 mutations. Using this approach and an in vitro competition assay with human cytokines (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 1c), we found that DNMT3A-knockdown (DNMT3A-KD) HSPCs displayed a competitive advantage over control HSPCs expressing a non-targeting shRNA (shNT) (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Consistent with our mouse studies, metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A-KD HSPCs (Fig. 5b). The effects of DNMT3A knockdown and metformin treatment were observed in both the CD34+ and CD34-cell fractions following ex vivo culture (Extended Data Fig. 8c). The suppressive effect of metformin was mitigated by the co-expression of NDI1 (Fig. 5b), indicating that the effect was mediated through inhibition of complex I. DNMT3A-KD HSPCs exhibited higher basal OCRs compared with control HSPCs, a difference that was eliminated by metformin treatment (Fig. 5c). Similar to mouse Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs, the levels of 5mCand H3K27me3 were lower in DNMT3A-KD cells than in control cells (Fig. 5d,e). Metformin treatment augmented the methylation index (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 8d) and increased 5mC and H3K27me3 in DNMT3A-KD cells (Fig. 5d,e), mirroring the mechanistic findings observed in mouse Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs. To further evaluate the effect of metformin on DNMT3A R882-mutated human HSPCs, we designed and optimized a prime editing strategy to introduce the R882H mutation into the DNMT3A gene in purified CD34+ HSPCs from cord blood samples. The Cas nickase (nCas)-based prime editing technique has been shown to cause less cytotoxic and genotoxic stress and edit with higher precision and efficiency in long-term repopulating HSPCs than conventional homology-directed repair-based CRISPR-Cas9 editing strategies (Ref: 26). Using the optimized prime editing strategy, we introduced the DNMT3AR882H mutation in five HSPC samples from independent donors. As a negative control, we introduced a T>G single nucleotide variant in exon 1 of the B2M gene that causes a premature stop codon (Ref: 26). After prime editing, the baseline (day 0) mean variant allele frequency (VAF) was 20% for DNMT3AR882H (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 8e) and 49.8% for the B2M single nucleotide variant (Fig. 5h). The edited cell pools were plated in methylcellulose medium to assess the relative competitive advantage of the DNMT3AR882H versus DNMT3A wild-type cells. After an additional 14 days in culture, the mean VAF of DNMT3A R882H increased to 42.4% in untreated cells, consistent with a relative expansion of the mutant population (Fig.5g). Metformin treatment suppressed the expansion of DNMT3A-mutated cells with a mean VAF of 26.2% (Fig. 5g). By contrast, the mean VAFs of B2M-edited cells did not significantly change after 14 days in culture with or without metformin treatment (Fig. 5h), indicating that the observed effects on DNMT3AR882H HSPCs were not an artefact of prime editing. Together, these results support the idea that metformin has the potential to suppress the competitive advantage of DNMT3A R882-mutated clones in human clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n> Fig. 5 | Metformin suppresses human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs. a, Schematic diagram of the in vitro competition assay of human CD34+-enriched HSPCs.
