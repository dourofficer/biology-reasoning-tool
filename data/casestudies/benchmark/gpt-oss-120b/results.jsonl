{"title": "Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity", "subsection": "Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range", "premise_finding": "Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.", "connecting_principle": "Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).", "interpretation": "These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development."}
{"title": "Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity", "subsection": "Transplanted enhancers are accessible", "premise_finding": "Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a).", "connecting_principle": "It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-distance enhancers(Ref: 34,35).", "interpretation": "These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range."}
{"title": "Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity", "subsection": "The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range", "premise_finding": "All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b).", "connecting_principle": "Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41).", "interpretation": "Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene."}
{"title": "Taurine from tumour niche drives glycolysis to promote leukaemogenesis", "subsection": "TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis", "premise_finding": "TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady\u2011state (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013e).", "connecting_principle": "These results are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC\u2011enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self\u2011renewal.", "interpretation": "These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady\u2011state haematopoiesis, it can impact long\u2011term HSC self\u2011renewal and maintenance."}
{"title": "Taurine from tumour niche drives glycolysis to promote leukaemogenesis", "subsection": "Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia", "premise_finding": "TAUT loss resulted in a 2.2\u2011 to 3\u2011fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k\u2013m).", "connecting_principle": "Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.", "interpretation": "Collectively, our studies show that the taurine\u2011TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG\u2011mediated activation of mTOR signalling."}
