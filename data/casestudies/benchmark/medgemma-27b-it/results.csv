Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g).,"The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8). MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement induces a neuronal state,"To examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state, we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front. Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k).",A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).,"Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16). We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14,17).",Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16).,We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Confined A375 cells also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 × 10⁻¹²; Fig. 2f-h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved-again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g).",Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).,"(The interpretation is that confinement causes structural changes resembling neurons, linked to the prior Premise.)"
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus.","During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23).",We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"In confined cells, nocodazole (1 µM) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Ref: 24). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j).",Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19).,This indicates that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j).",Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19).,(missing - The premise is about the effect of nocodazole on tubulin structures. The interpretation is embedded within the next premise/conclusion.)
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,Results,"We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ (n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a+/+ (n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports (Ref: 13, 17), the majority of the DMRs (n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples (Fig. 4a).","The mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de novo DNA methylation activity (Ref: 13, 17). In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent (Ref: 13).","We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage."
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,Results,"We performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Dnmt3aR878H/+ and Dnmt3a+/+ LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This analysis revealed a reduction in H3K27me3 levels globally and in the regions surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) in the untreated Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples relative to the untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d). Consistent with our hypothesis, metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d).","In human clonal haematopoiesis, the DNMT3A R882 mutation has previously been reported to result in preferential DNA hypomethylation of targets of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (Ref: 17), which catalyses the methylation of histone H3 K27 (H3K27). In addition, the Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Ref: 25), indicating its potential influence on another layer of epigenetic regulation.","Given that PRC2-mediated methylation activity is also regulated by the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio, we hypothesized that metformin could reverse the aberrant H3K27 hypomethylation profile in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors,"Tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as Nfe2l2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1.","In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as Nfe2l2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (Ref: 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA (Ref: 17)","These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation"
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells,"We next sought to determine the fate of the LDL-cholesterol actively taken up by C1-Liver cells, and its specific role in promoting survival and colonization of the liver. Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1 (refs. 33,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig. 4b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling.","Lysosomal cholesterol activates mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation (Ref: 33,34). mTORC1 activity is reflected by phosphorylation of downstream targets like p70S6K and 4EBP1.","High LDL uptake leads to lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, which activates mTORC1, promoting proliferation in C1-Liver cells."
