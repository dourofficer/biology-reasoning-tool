Q1*	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	To study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion	N/A	we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma
Q2*	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	Across fish, we found a conserved ‘interface’ transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment 6 (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a)	Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle	N/A
Q1	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients	a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7	we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets
Q2*	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	"a subpopulation of human tumour cells
highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients
(Extended Data Fig. 1d–f)"	Similar to our previous observations6	N/A
Q1	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	To better understand the nature of these cells	A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated)	"we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states...We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into
each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state2."
Q2	Tumour gene expression altered by TME	Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). ... Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log2 fold change (FC) = −5.19), TYRP1 (log2FC = −7.75) and PMEL (log2FC = −8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log2FC = 5.15), NNAT (log2FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log2FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log2FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i).	Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others8. MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation9,10, whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state11	These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
Q1*	Confinement induces a neuronal state	To examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state	N/A	we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front.
Q2	Confinement induces a neuronal state	Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j,k)	"A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically
restrictive environments12."	Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.
Q1	Confinement induces a neuronal state	To test this hypothesis	a system to confine human melanoma cells ... in vitro at predefined heights ... using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips13.	we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in vitro at predefined heights (3 µm) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips13 (Fig. 1l).

Q2	Confinement induces a neuronal state	Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3).	N/A	These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity	Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function14. The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli15. Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage16.	"We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal
mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment ... confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons"
Q1*	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment ... confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons	N/A	We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin
Q2*	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2–4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).	"This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling
or rupture in response to force16"	N/A

Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells	"Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs18. Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure19. Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived,
stabilized MTs19."	enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border
Q1*	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border?	N/A	We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAFV600E-driven melanomas
Q2**	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 × 10−12; Fig. 2f–h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved—again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g).	N/A	N/A
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)	"As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced
stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage20,21. During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus22,23."	hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus
Q1	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	"We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT
network"	nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism24...Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole19	by treating confined cells with nocodazole
Q2**	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Nocodazole (1 µM) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j).	N/A	N/A
Q1	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Which acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.	the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1)	We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b),
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c–e). 	N/A	This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear	In addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability25.	clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network
Q1*	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network	N/A	we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d)	Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs26	probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma27
Q2	Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton	Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for poly-glutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h).	N/A	This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network
