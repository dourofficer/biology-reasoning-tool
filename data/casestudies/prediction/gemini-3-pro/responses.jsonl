Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\nQUERY: Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells", "type": "Q2", "subsection": "Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton", "main": "Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells", "context": "Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs18.

We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant.

Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions (Ref: 1). More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\nQUERY: Which acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.", "type": "Q1", "subsection": "Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton", "main": "Which acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.", "context": "the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1)", "outcome": "We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b),"}

More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states (Ref: 3,4). The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one (Ref: 5). Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\nQUERY: These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons ...Acetylated tubulin\nfilaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved\u2014again indicative of stabilization ...We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)", "type": "Q2", "subsection": "Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton", "main": "These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons ...Acetylated tubulin\nfilaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved\u2014again indicative of stabilization ...We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)", "context": "N/A", "outcome": "These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons."}
