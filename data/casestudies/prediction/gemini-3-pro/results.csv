Q1*,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,To study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion,N/A,we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma,"The interface between the tumor and the surrounding tissue is the active boundary where physical interactions, such as mechanical confinement, are most likely to trigger phenotypic changes distinct from the tumor bulk.",Perform high-resolution morphological analysis of tumor cells located at the interface between the tumor and surrounding microenvironment in a zebrafish melanoma model to assess nuclear shape and signs of physical confinement.
Q2*,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"Across fish, we found a conserved ‘interface’ transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment 6 (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a)","Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle",N/A,"It is established that tumor heterogeneity is often spatially defined, where specific physical or chemical cues present at the tumor boundary—such as mechanical confinement or interaction with healthy tissue—can trigger distinct adaptive responses compared to the tumor core.","This suggests that the 'interface' state represents a specific, spatially induced phenotype arising from microenvironmental interactions at the tumor edge, potentially serving as the specialized engine for invasion and metastasis."
Q1,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,To investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients,"a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7","we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma7 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets","In the zebrafish model, 'interface cells' at the tumor boundary are characterized by specific morphological traits (elliptical nuclei suggestive of mechanical confinement) and the upregulation of specific chromatin-remodeling proteins (HMGB2); validating these findings in humans requires visualizing these specific spatial and molecular features within the native tissue architecture of clinical specimens.",Perform immunohistochemical staining and morphological analysis on human melanoma tissue sections (or tissue microarrays) to evaluate nuclear shape and HMGB2 expression levels specifically at the tumor-stroma interface compared to the tumor bulk.
Q2*,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"a subpopulation of human tumour cells
highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients
(Extended Data Fig. 1d–f)",Similar to our previous observations6,N/A,"It is well established that phenotypic plasticity, specifically the transition from a proliferative to a slow-cycling or invasive state, is often associated with increased resistance to therapeutics and immune evasion in melanoma.","This suggests that the mechanically confined interface phenotype represents a distinct, drug-tolerant cellular state that allows tumors to survive immunotherapy, thereby functioning as a driver of clinical treatment resistance."
Q1,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,To better understand the nature of these cells,"A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated)","we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states...We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into
each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state2.","To characterize the specific phenotypic state of tumor cells located at the physical boundary between the tumor and the microenvironment, it is necessary to resolve gene expression heterogeneity with spatial context, distinguishing interface cells from the bulk tumor population.",We performed spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on zebrafish melanoma models and human samples to profile the transcriptional signatures of cells specifically located at the tumor-microenvironment interface.
Q2,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c). ... Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log2 fold change (FC) = −5.19), TYRP1 (log2FC = −7.75) and PMEL (log2FC = −8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log2FC = 5.15), NNAT (log2FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log2FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log2FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i).","Melanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others8. MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation9,10, whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state11",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.,It is well established in melanoma biology that the loss of lineage-specifying transcription factors (such as MITF and SOX10) combined with the activation of neural crest or neuronal precursor pathways serves as a hallmark of dedifferentiation and phenotypic plasticity.,"This indicates that the tumor interface microenvironment specifically drives a phenotypic switch where melanoma cells lose their differentiated identity and adopt a distinct neuronal-like, undifferentiated state."
Q1*,Confinement induces a neuronal state,To examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state,N/A,"we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front.",The observation that cells at the tumor interface exhibit elliptical nuclei indicative of mechanical confinement suggests that specific adjacent host tissues or structural barriers provide the physical compressive forces necessary to trigger this phenotypic switch.,"Perform high-resolution imaging (e.g., confocal microscopy) or spatial profiling of the zebrafish melanoma boundary to identify the specific host cell types (such as the basal keratinocyte layer) that physically encase the tumor and impose mechanical stress."
Q2,Confinement induces a neuronal state,"Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j,k)","A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically
restrictive environments12.","Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.",Nuclear elongation or deformation is a characteristic morphological signature of cells subjected to physical compression or mechanical confinement by surrounding dense tissues.,"This indicates that invading cells at the tumour-microenvironment interface experience significant mechanical confinement forces from adjacent tissues, unlike cells within the bulk tumour."

PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a–f).",N/A,Confinement in vitro was not cytotoxic,"Cleaved caspase-3, annexin V, and cleaved PARP are canonical biomarkers of apoptosis (programmed cell death), and significant mechanical deformation is often potentially cytotoxic to cells.","This confirms that the mechanical confinement applied in this model is sublethal, indicating that the cells remain viable and that the observed phenotypic changes represent an adaptive functional switch rather than a stress-induced death response."
Q2**,Confinement induces a neuronal state,"Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended
Data Fig. 2g).",N/A,N/A,"Reversibility of a cellular phenotype upon the removal of an external stimulus is a hallmark of adaptive plasticity, distinguishing dynamic state transitions from permanent genetic selection or irreversible cytotoxic damage.",This indicates that the confinement-induced changes represent a reversible mechanism of phenotype switching rather than a permanent selective pressure or a toxicity-induced response.
Q1*,Confinement induces a neuronal state,To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression,N/A,we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq,"Tumor cells located at the interface with the surrounding microenvironment experience mechanical forces that result in distinct nuclear morphologies (elliptical nuclei) compared to cells in the tumor core. Because phenotypic plasticity allows cells to shift between proliferative and invasive states based on these local microenvironmental cues, analyzing the bulk tumor would obscure these spatially restricted and heterogeneous transcriptional changes.",Perform spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on melanoma samples to identify distinct gene programs enriched in cells located at the tumor-microenvironment interface.
Q2**,Confinement induces a neuronal state,Principal component analysis revealed considerabletranscriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2).,N/A,N/A,"It is well established that phenotypic plasticity in cancer, such as the switching between proliferative and invasive states, requires global reprogramming of gene expression profiles to establish a new cellular identity.","This indicates that mechanical confinement acts as a distinct external driver of phenotypic switching, forcing melanoma cells to undergo the necessary transcriptional reprogramming to adopt a specific, likely invasive, state."
Q2,Confinement induces a neuronal state,"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3).",N/A,These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.,"Melanoma cells originate from the neural crest lineage and possess the intrinsic capacity to exhibit phenotypic plasticity by reactivating embryonic, neural-like gene programs to facilitate migration and dedifferentiation.","This suggests that mechanical confinement functions as a critical microenvironmental cue that triggers a lineage-specific transcriptomic reprogramming, driving melanoma cells toward a neuronal-like invasive state."
Q2,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity,"Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function14. The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli15. Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage16.","We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal
mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment ... confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons",It is established that the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 mediates chromatin architecture and that its contact time with chromatin can be modulated by physical constraints to alter transcriptional accessibility.,"Therefore, this suggests that the mechanical microenvironment directly regulates phenotypic switching by prolonging HMGB2-chromatin interaction, thereby inducing epigenetic remodeling that favors an invasive, drug-resistant neuronal gene program over a proliferative state."
Q1*,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment ... confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons,N/A,We used our in vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin,"Acetylated tubulin is a marker of stable microtubules, which are abundant in neurons and essential for maintaining structural integrity; establishing the presence of a perinuclear 'cage' of acetylated tubulin would indicate a specific structural adaptation used to protect the nucleus from mechanical stress during migration.","Perform high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy on melanoma cells subjected to mechanical confinement (e.g., in microchannels) using antibodies against acetylated tubulin to visualize the formation of protective perinuclear cages."
Q2*,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2–4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).","This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling
or rupture in response to force16",N/A,"It is established that the nucleus is the stiffest organelle within the cell and acts as a mechanical limiting factor during migration through confined spaces, often requiring cytoskeletal shielding to prevent rupture and DNA damage.","This observation indicates that mechanical confinement triggers the assembly of a protective microtubule cage around the nucleus, a structural adaptation that preserves nuclear integrity to facilitate the invasive migration state."
Q2*,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs,"reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization14,17.",N/A,"Canonical radial microtubule arrays anchored at a central centrosome are typically associated with the structural architecture of proliferative cells, whereas cytoskeletal remodeling is a prerequisite for adapting to migratory or invasive phenotypes.","This suggests that under confinement, melanoma cells actively dismantle the machinery required for proliferation to reconfigure their cytoskeleton into a protective tubulin cage, thereby facilitating the transition to a distinct invasive state."
Q2,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells","Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs18. Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure19. Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived,
stabilized MTs19.",enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border,"Microtubules are inherently stiff structural filaments, and their significant curvature or buckling is a biomechanical signature of accumulating elastic energy under compressive load.","This suggests that the microtubule network is actively resisting external mechanical forces, effectively acting as a loaded spring or protective cage to withstand the pressure of environmental confinement."

Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved—again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g).",N/A,N/A,"Acetylation of alpha-tubulin is a well-characterized post-translational modification that serves as a marker for stable, long-lived microtubules, distinguishing them from more dynamic populations and often conferring resistance to mechanical breakage.","These findings indicate that mechanical confinement induces a cytoskeletal restructuring in melanoma cells, promoting the assembly of a highly stabilized microtubule network likely required to maintain cellular integrity or facilitate migration under compressive forces."
Q2,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"We noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g)","As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced
stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage20,21. During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus22,23.",hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus,"It is well established that acetylation enhances the mechanical stability and flexibility of microtubules, and that perinuclear microtubule cages act as structural reinforcements to protect the nucleus from mechanical deformation and rupture during migration through narrow physical constraints.","Therefore, this cytoskeletal reorganization likely functions as a mechanical adaptation to confinement, shielding the nucleus from compressive forces to preserve genomic integrity during the transition to an invasive phenotype."
Q1,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT

Q2**,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Nocodazole (1 µM) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j).",N/A,N/A,"It is well established that Nocodazole acts as a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that effectively disrupts dynamic, non-modified microtubules, whereas tubulin acetylation is a post-translational modification associated with highly stable, long-lived microtubules that are resistant to chemical depolymerization.","This indicates that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage formed under mechanical confinement represents a structurally distinct and highly stabilized microtubule population that confers resistance to depolymerization, differentiating it from the dynamic cytoskeleton found in unconfined cells."
Q1,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,Which acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.,the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1),"We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b),","The formation of a stable, acetylated tubulin cage is a key structural adaptation for nuclear protection during confined migration, and alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) is the canonical enzyme responsible for acetylating alpha-tubulin at Lysine 40 to enhance microtubule flexibility and stability.",Perform shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATAT1 in melanoma cells subjected to mechanical confinement and assess the loss of tubulin acetylation and nuclear integrity using immunofluorescence microscopy.

Q2,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d),Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs26,probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma27,"It is well established that tubulin tyrosination serves as a marker for dynamic, newly polymerized microtubules, contrasting with post-translational modifications like acetylation which characterize stable, long-lived microtubule structures.","This suggests that the global microtubule network retains its dynamic character regardless of the confinement state, implying that the specific ""acetylated tubulin cage"" observed in confined cells represents a targeted structural adaptation rather than a global shift toward cytoskeletal stabilization."
Q2,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a–d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for poly-glutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h).",N/A,This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network,"Distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate the stability and mechanical properties of microtubules, with specific modifications often being required to form specialized structures that protect organelles against physical stress.","This suggests that the formation of the protective perinuclear cage in mechanically confined melanoma cells is uniquely mediated by microtubule acetylation, rather than by other common tubulin modifications such as tyrosination or poly-glutamylation."
