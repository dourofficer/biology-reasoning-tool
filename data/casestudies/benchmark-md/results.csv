We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization (Ref: 14, 17).",The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli (Ref: 15). Recent reports indicate that the microtubule cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage (Ref: 16).,These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.
mechanical,Confined A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 × 10-12; Fig. 2f-h).,"Acetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs (Ref: 18). Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19). Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells, are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs (Ref: 19). During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22, 23).",We hypothesized that the hyperacetylated tubulin cage protects the nucleus during migration.
mechanical,"Nocodazole (1 μM) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j).",Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole (Ref: 19).,"The perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage in confined cells remains stable under nocodazole, suggesting it protects the nucleus."
mechanical,"We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e).",(implicit),This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.
mechanical,"Most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27). Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h).",Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26).,These data indicate that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.
mechanical,"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).",(implicit),indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.
mechanical,"We examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f).",(implicit),indicating that confinement‐induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.
mechanical,"Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2 + and AcTub + ), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub + and HMGB2 - ), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2 + nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub - and HMGB2 + ) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).",(implicit),"This validates our scRNA‑seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c)."
mechanical,"Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells ( P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 ± 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 ± 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i).",(implicit),"confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions."
mechanical,"Unexpectedly, HMGB2 accumulation was not impaired in ATAT1 KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f).",(implicit),Acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement.
mechanical,"Targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).","nesprin 2 (gene name: SYNE2), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36).",This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.
mechanical,"Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells ( P = 1.28 × 10 -162 ; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g).",The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).,"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening."

range_extender,"We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d).",(implicit),"These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances."
taurine,Clustering analyses of genes expressed in major lineages identified gene sets with similar changes in expression (Extended Data Fig. 1f).,(implicit),suggesting that these may represent altered stromal cell fate.
taurine,"Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a).",(implicit),indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression.
taurine,"We next determined whether disease progression could alter the expression of LSC-specific TME ligands, and identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression.",(implicit),"Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease."
taurine,"We used NicheNet and the published literature to identify ligands for these receptors, especially those that were significantly upregulated in our TME scRNA-seq data and in the human AML immune microenvironment (Extended Data Fig. 2e).",(implicit),We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig. 2a).
taurine,"inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig. 2h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5h)",(implicit),indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival.
taurine,Cdo1 fl/fl Prrx1-cre + mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls,(implicit),"indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression, at least in part."
taurine,Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of mouse LSCs and patient-derived AML cells increased by 1.2- to 3.3-fold in the presence of taurine (Extended Data Fig. 5o-q). Taurine supplements could significantly accelerate disease progression in immunocompetent mice (around threefold higher likelihood of death relative to the controls; Extended Data Fig. 5r),(implicit),indicating that taurine can promote leukaemic progression.
taurine,(implicit),(implicit),"Collectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs."
taurine,TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig. 6a),(implicit),indicating that they could not respond to taurine being produced by the niche
taurine,"TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig. 3i-k). Slc6a6 -/-KIT + AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig. 3l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs",(implicit),"These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemias"
taurine,"While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig. 7f,g)",(implicit),"These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance"
taurine,"SLC6A6 expression is also enriched in ROS‑low LSCs from human monocytic AMLs and is highly expressed in relapsed AML (Fig. 4b; CD45 med SSC low CD117 + CD11b CD68 - ) (Ref: 32).  We find increased SLC6A6 expression in leukaemia cells carrying RAS mutations as compared to wild‑type cells, consistent with data correlating RAS mutations with venetoclax resistance (Ref: 33) (Fig. 4c). SLC6A6 is also highly expressed in relapsed AML originating from stem/progenitor like cells compared with more committed populations (Ref: 34) (Extended Data Fig. 8c).",(implicit),"inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance."
taurine,"While TAG, GES or venetoclax alone could impair mouse LSC colony formation by 1.4- to 3.9-fold, their combination was synergistic and led to 2.3- to 7.2-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig. 8k-m). While primary human AML cells that were treated with GES, TAG or venetoclax alone formed 1.3- to 8.3-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls, combining the treatments substantially impaired colony formation by 2.4- to 150-fold.",(implicit),taurine inhibitors can synergize with venetoclax in blocking the growth of human AML cells.
taurine,"Knocking down SLC6A6 expression using two independent shRNAs significantly impaired taurine uptake by 2.2 to 3.4-fold, as well as the colony‑forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines by 2- to 12-fold (Extended Data Fig. 9k-p). Our experiments showed that SLC6A6 knockdown in samples from patients with AML reduced their colony‑forming ability by 2.33- to 9.12-fold as compared to the controls (Fig. 4i). By contrast, SLC6A6 knockdown did not impact colonies formed by normal human CD34+ HSPCs (Fig. 4j).",(implicit),"Collectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias."
taurine,"Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 -/- LSCs could be significantly rescued by pyruvate, sodium acetate and lactate, but not glucagon (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10c-e).",(implicit),"These data suggest that glycolysis, and not gluconeogenesis, is the primary downstream effector of taurine in leukaemia cells."
taurine,"Membrane-permeable taurine fully rescued colonies formed by Slc6a6 -/- cells (Fig. 5g), and N-acetyl-taurine partly rescued this defect (Extended Data Fig. 10h), perhaps by breakdown to taurine and acetate (Ref: 37). By contrast, glutaurine was unable to rescue the Slc6a6 -/- colony formation (Extended Data Fig. 10i).",(implicit),"These experiments indicate that taurine, and not a secondary metabolite, promotes leukaemia growth due to an indirect effect on glycolysis, possibly through downstream signalling."
taurine,"TAUT loss results in a 2.2- to 3-fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k-m and Extended Data Fig. 11e).",As mTOR signalling is known to regulate expression of glycolysis-related genes (Ref: 38),"Collectively, these data indicate that mTOR signalling has a key role downstream of taurine in leukaemia cells."
taurine,"Our experiments showed that, while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6 -/- colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5p).","Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.","Collectively, these studies show that the taurine-TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG-mediated activation of mTOR signalling."
