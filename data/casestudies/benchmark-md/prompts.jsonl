Chan 1,3 \u2709\n\nClonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses 1-4 . Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot 1-3,5-7 . Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3A R882H/+ , have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration 8 , reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3A R882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers 1-3,5,6 . DNMT3A encodes a de\u00a0novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) 7,9 . Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations 10,11 . Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention.\n\nThe mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous 12,13 . DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner 13,14 . Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts 13,15 .\n\nThe effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs 16 , thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Increased OXPHOS in Dnmt3a R878H/+  HSPCs\n\nAnalysis of publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from primary AML samples revealed an increase in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in DNMT3A R882-mutated patient samples, but not in non-R882 DNMT3A -mutated samples, compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a). To validate this finding in the context of clonal haematopoiesis, we analysed a previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of CD34 + -enriched HSPCs from individuals with clonal haematopoiesis 17 . Pseudobulk differential expression analysis also showed an increase in OXPHOS gene expression in DNMT3A R882-mutated cells relative to wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01b).\n\nThese findings led us to explore the potential for differences in mitochondrial function between Dnmt3a R878H/+ and Dnmt3a +/+ mouse HSPCs. We found that Dnmt3a R878H/+ lineage-negative, KIT-positive (LK) cells, which are enriched for HSPCs, possessed higher levels of basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) than Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells, as determined by extracellular flux analysis (Fig.\u00a01a). These differences were also observed in unfractionated whole bone marrow (WBM) cells, albeit by a smaller magnitude (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01c). Furthermore, the level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u2206 \u03a8 m) to mitochondrial mass were higher in mutant LK cells than in wild-type LK cells (Fig.\u00a01b,c). Together, these findings indicate that the Dnmt3a R878H mutation causes metabolic reprogramming in HSPCs, resulting in upregulation of OXPHOS.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Dependency on mitochondrial respiration\n\nWe postulated that the increased mitochondrial respiration in Dnmt3a R878H HSPCs is required for their competitive advantage over wild-type cells. To test this, we first established an in\u00a0vitro competition assay in which CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ and CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells were mixed at a ratio of approximately 2:3 and cultured in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium for around 10 days, followed by determination of the proportions of CD45.2 + and CD45.1 + cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). A parallel competition assay between CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ and CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells mixed at the same starting ratio served as a control. After the culture period, the proportion of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells was consistently 20% to 30% higher than that of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ cells in the first passage and 40% to 50% higher in the second passage (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e), demonstrating the competitive advantage of the mutant cells. Using this assay, we studied the effect of genetic knockdown of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunits on the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs by transducing the mixed CD45.2 + mutant-CD45.1 + wild-type population with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Ndufv1 and Cox15 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a), which encode critical subunits in complex I and complex IV of the ETC, respectively. Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells (Fig.\u00a01d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\n\nTo explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin-a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I 8 -on Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs. Consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration 18 (50 \u03bcM) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in\u00a0vitro (Fig.\u00a01f). This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, a metformin-resistant yeast analogue of complex I 19,20 , thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition (Fig.\u00a01g). Metformin treatment also selectively reduced the clonogenic potential of Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs over Dnmt3a +/+ LK HSPCs in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b).\n\nTo determine whether the effect of metformin was relevant in\u00a0vivo and over a longer treatment period, we conducted a competitive repopulation experiment by mixing CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ or Dnmt3a +/+  WBM cells with CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ WBM cells at a 2:3 ratio and transplanting the mixed cells into lethally irradiated recipients (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c). Five weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin in their drinking water at 5 mg ml -1 , a concentration that has previously been shown to result in blood concentrations similar to those achievable in humans 21 . Peripheral blood chimerism analysis showed a stable ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells in mice that received CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ control cells, and the ratio was not affected by metformin treatment (Fig.\u00a01h and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). By contrast, the ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells steadily increased over a 7-month period in mice that received CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells, reflecting their competitive advantage over CD45.1 + wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a01h). Notably, metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig.\u00a01h). This effect was observed in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). Our findings collectively indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration is a potential strategy for targeting DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

To test this, we first established an in\u00a0vitro competition assay in which CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ and CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells were mixed at a ratio of approximately 2:3 and cultured in cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium for around 10 days, followed by determination of the proportions of CD45.2 + and CD45.1 + cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). A parallel competition assay between CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ and CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells mixed at the same starting ratio served as a control. After the culture period, the proportion of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells was consistently 20% to 30% higher than that of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ cells in the first passage and 40% to 50% higher in the second passage (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e), demonstrating the competitive advantage of the mutant cells. Using this assay, we studied the effect of genetic knockdown of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) subunits on the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs by transducing the mixed CD45.2 + mutant-CD45.1 + wild-type population with lentiviral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Ndufv1 and Cox15 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a), which encode critical subunits in complex I and complex IV of the ETC, respectively. Downregulation of these genes reduced the basal OCR and competitive advantage of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells (Fig.\u00a01d,e), indicating that mutant HSPCs are dependent on increased OXPHOS to outcompete their wild-type counterparts.\n\nTo explore the translational relevance of this finding, we tested the effect of metformin-a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I 8 -on Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs. Consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration 18 (50 \u03bcM) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in\u00a0vitro (Fig.\u00a01f). This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, a metformin-resistant yeast analogue of complex I 19,20 , thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition (Fig.\u00a01g). Metformin treatment also selectively reduced the clonogenic potential of Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs over Dnmt3a +/+ LK HSPCs in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b).\n\nTo determine whether the effect of metformin was relevant in\u00a0vivo and over a longer treatment period, we conducted a competitive repopulation experiment by mixing CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ or Dnmt3a +/+  WBM cells with CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ WBM cells at a 2:3 ratio and transplanting the mixed cells into lethally irradiated recipients (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c). Five weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin in their drinking water at 5 mg ml -1 , a concentration that has previously been shown to result in blood concentrations similar to those achievable in humans 21 . Peripheral blood chimerism analysis showed a stable ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells in mice that received CD45.2 + Dnmt3a +/+ control cells, and the ratio was not affected by metformin treatment (Fig.\u00a01h and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). By contrast, the ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells steadily increased over a 7-month period in mice that received CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells, reflecting their competitive advantage over CD45.1 + wild-type cells (Fig.\u00a01h). Notably, metformin decreased this competitive advantage up to 7 months (Fig.\u00a01h). This effect was observed in both the myeloid and lymphoid compartments (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b).

Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses 1-4 . Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot 1-3,5-7 . Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3A R882H/+ , have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration 8 , reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3A R882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers 1-3,5,6 . DNMT3A encodes a de\u00a0novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) 7,9 . Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations 10,11 . Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention.\n\nThe mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous 12,13 . DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner 13,14 . Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts 13,15 .\n\nThe effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs 16 , thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Metformin suppresses Dnmt3a R878H/+  HSCs\n\nMetformin suppressed the long-term competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ donor cells in\u00a0vivo (Fig.\u00a01h), reflective of an effect at the HSC level. To provide independent evidence for an effect at the HSC level and gain insights into the mechanism of action of metformin, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the untreated and metformin-treated recipients at the end of the 7-month treatment period (Fig.\u00a01h). The cells were collected from the mice transplanted with CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ and CD45.1 + Dnmt3a +/+ competitor cells and stained with antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates specific for CD45.2 or CD45.1 to identify their donor origin. A total of 22,407 cells from untreated control mice ( n = 2) were sequenced, 84.6% of which were CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells (Fig.\u00a02a). For comparison, a total of 23,818 cells from metformin-treated mice ( n = 2) were sequenced, and the proportion of CD45.2 + Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells was significantly less at 56.5% ( P &lt; 0.0001 by chi-square test) (Fig.\u00a02a). To determine which HSPC subsets were affected, we annotated each cell on the basis of their correlation with reference mouse HSPC gene sets 22 and identified 11 different haematopoietic subsets (Fig.\u00a02a). Metformin treatment reduced the ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells in the HSC cluster as well as myeloid progenitor subsets (Fig.\u00a02b,c), consistent with its effect at the HSC level. Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow samples collected from mice after 4 months of treatment also showed a reduction in the ratio of CD45.2 + to CD45.1 + cells in immunophenotypically defined (Lin -KIT + SCA-1 + CD150 + CD48 ) HSCs and progenitor subsets (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a,b).\n\nTo corroborate these findings, we transplanted Dnmt3a R878H/+ or Dnmt3a +/+ donor WBM cells from sex-matched littermates in a non-competitive manner into lethally irradiated recipients. Five weeks after transplantation, the recipients were either left untreated or started on treatment with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). In untreated mice, the number of immunophenotypic HSCs per femur and the proportion of HSCs in the Lin -SCA-1 + KIT + (LSK) fraction were higher in Dnmt3a R878H/+ recipients compared with Dnmt3a +/+ recipients (Fig.\u00a02d,e). The expansion of mutant HSCs was associated with a trend towards a higher proportion of HSCs in active cycling based on Ki-67 staining (Fig.\u00a02f). Metformin treatment reduced all these parameters in Dnmt3a R878H/+ recipients to levels comparable to those in untreated Dnmt3a +/+ recipients (Fig.\u00a02d-f).

Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Metformin increases methylation capacity\n\nGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the scRNA-seq data revealed an enrichment of genes associated with OXPHOS in Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSCs relative to wild-type HSCs and a decrease in expression of these genes with metformin treatment (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a,b). This unexpected result suggested that metformin could influence mitochondrial respiration not only through a direct inhibition of complex I but also through downregulation of OXPHOS-related genes. To further investigate its mechanism of action, we first studied the effect of in\u00a0vivo metformin treatment on mitochondrial function of HSPCs. We performed extracellular flux analysis on freshly isolated LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). Metformin treatment reduced the basal and maximal OCRs as well as the \u2206 \u03a8 m of Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells to levels similar to those of untreated Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c,d). To uncover the effect of metformin on specific metabolic pathways, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the untreated and treated LK cells of both Dnmt3a genotypes. This analysis, which focused on metabolites that are central to energy and redox metabolism, detected 101 named metabolites, of which 8 were significantly increased in metformin-treated mutant LK cells compared with untreated mutant cells (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Of note, 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites (L-cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig.\u00a03a,b). Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels and the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the intracellular concentrations of SAM and SAH, which were below the detection threshold of the bulk metabolomic analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, the methylation index was higher in metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c), indicative of an increase in their cellular methylation potential. The effect of metformin on methylation index was observed only in Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs and not in Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03c).\n\nTo determine whether the metformin-induced changes in methylation index could be due to alterations in the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of Dnmt3a +/+ and Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK-enriched cells that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). GSEA of the RNA-seq dataset showed that metformin treatment decreased the expression of genes associated with stemness and OXPHOS (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04e,f), consistent with our earlier results. Notably, it also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in 1C metabolism in metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03d). To confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles ( Shmt2 , Mthfd2l , Shmt1 , Mthfd1 , Mthfr , Ahcy , Cbs and Bhmt ) and found that metformin treatment increased their expression in Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03e). Although metformin also up-regulated expression of these genes in Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells, the magnitude of change was much smaller (Fig.\u00a03e). These findings suggest that metformin selectively increases the cellular methylation potential of mutant HSPCs by upregulating the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism.\n\nOn the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized that metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells by increasing their cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of exogenous SAM and SAH on the competitive advantage of mutant LK cells using our in\u00a0vitro assay (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01d). The addition of exogenous SAM, which increases the methylation index, was sufficient to reduce the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). The suppressive effect of SAM on Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs was maintained after downregulation of Dnmt3b expression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05b,c), suggesting that this effect was independent of DNMT3B activity. Increasing the concentration of folic acid in the culture medium, which augments the availability of 1C units for SAM synthesis, also reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05d). Conversely, exogenous SAH, which lowers the methylation index, counteracted the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). To confirm these findings, we inhibited SHMT2 and MAT2A as alternative approaches to lowering the [SAM]/[SAH] ratio. SHMT2 generates a 1C unit (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) that is necessary for SAM synthesis through the folate and methionine cycles, and MAT2A directly catalyses the synthesis of SAM from methionine (Fig.\u00a03a). In line with our hypothesis, pharmacologic inhibition of SHMT with SHIN-1 23 or MAT2A with AG-270 24 rescued the suppressive effect of metformin on mutant HSPCs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e,f). The addition of exogenous SAM mitigated the rescue effect of SHIN-1 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05g), indicating that SHIN-1 acts by reducing SAM production. Genetic knockdown of Shmt2 expression also rendered Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs resistant to the suppressive effect of metformin (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h,i). Together, these findings support a mechanism in which metformin selectively reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs by increasing their cellular methylation potential.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

This unexpected result suggested that metformin could influence mitochondrial respiration not only through a direct inhibition of complex I but also through downregulation of OXPHOS-related genes. To further investigate its mechanism of action, we first studied the effect of in\u00a0vivo metformin treatment on mitochondrial function of HSPCs. We performed extracellular flux analysis on freshly isolated LK-enriched bone marrow cells from the mice that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). Metformin treatment reduced the basal and maximal OCRs as well as the \u2206 \u03a8 m of Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells to levels similar to those of untreated Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c,d). To uncover the effect of metformin on specific metabolic pathways, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of the untreated and treated LK cells of both Dnmt3a genotypes. This analysis, which focused on metabolites that are central to energy and redox metabolism, detected 101 named metabolites, of which 8 were significantly increased in metformin-treated mutant LK cells compared with untreated mutant cells (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Of note, 4 out of the 8 up-regulated metabolites (L-cysteate, dimethylglycine, reduced glutathione (GSH) and taurine) are involved in one-carbon (1C) metabolism through the methionine cycle (Fig.\u00a03a,b). Since the methionine cycle generates SAM, these findings suggest that metformin could potentially affect SAM levels and the ratio of SAM to SAH, which is also known as the methylation index, an indicator of cellular methylation potential. To test this hypothesis, we directly measured the intracellular concentrations of SAM and SAH, which were below the detection threshold of the bulk metabolomic analysis. Consistent with our hypothesis, the methylation index was higher in metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells than in untreated cells (Fig.\u00a03c), indicative of an increase in their cellular methylation potential. The effect of metformin on methylation index was observed only in Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK HSPCs and not in Dnmt3a +/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03c).\n\nTo determine whether the metformin-induced changes in methylation index could be due to alterations in the expression of genes involved in 1C metabolism, we performed bulk RNA-seq analysis of Dnmt3a +/+ and Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK-enriched cells that were untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). GSEA of the RNA-seq dataset showed that metformin treatment decreased the expression of genes associated with stemness and OXPHOS (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04e,f), consistent with our earlier results. Notably, it also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in 1C metabolism in metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03d). To confirm these findings, we performed quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) to measure the expression of eight genes that encode enzymes in the folate and methionine cycles ( Shmt2 , Mthfd2l , Shmt1 , Mthfd1 , Mthfr , Ahcy , Cbs and Bhmt ) and found that metformin treatment increased their expression in Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells (Fig.\u00a03e).

Chan 1,3 \u2709\n\nClonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses 1-4 . Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot 1-3,5-7 . Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3A R882H/+ , have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration 8 , reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3A R882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers 1-3,5,6 . DNMT3A encodes a de\u00a0novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) 7,9 . Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations 10,11 . Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention.\n\nThe mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous 12,13 . DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner 13,14 . Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts 13,15 .\n\nThe effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs 16 , thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles\n\nThe mechanism by which DNMT3A mutations confer a competitive advantage to mutant HSCs is believed to be mediated through focal DNA hypomethylation secondary to reduced de\u00a0novo DNA methylation activity 13,17 . In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent 13 . We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that elimination of residual DNMT3A activity by inactivating the remaining wild-type Dnmt3a allele in mutant cells should render them resistant to the effect of metformin. To test this prediction, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a +/+ and Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells. The knockout efficiency was approximately 98%, indicative of biallelic inactivation in both cell types (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a). Using our in\u00a0vitro competition assay, we found that Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs, regardless of their initial Dnmt3a genotype (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). Another prediction is that metformin treatment should increase the level of methylation at CpG sites that are differentially hypomethylated in Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells. To test this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis of LK-enriched bone marrow cells from recipient mice that received Dnmt3a R878H/+ or Dnmt3a +/+  WBM cells from sex-matched littermate donors and were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). The RRBS technique, which enriches for CpG-rich regions, was chosen because DNMT3A preferentially catalyses DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a +/+ ( n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports 13,17 , the majority of the DMRs ( n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04a). In the comparison between metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 3) and untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 4) samples, we identified 3,285 DMRs, 1,923\n\n\n\n(58.5%) of which were hypermethylated in the treated samples (Fig.\u00a04a). We found 870 overlapping DMRs at the intersection between these two sets (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c). In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3a R878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a +/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06d). Similar findings were observed in the subsets of DMRs associated with CpG islands and gene promoter regions (Fig.\u00a04a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c,d). To explore the potential effect of these changes in DNA methylation on gene expression, we conducted GSEA on genes ranked by differential promoter methylation and mRNA expression from our bulk RNA-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells, compared with Dnmt3a +/+ cells, exhibited decreased promoter methylation and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). Re-analysis of a previously published combined transcriptome and methylome dataset of single progenitor cells from individuals with DNMT3A R882-mutated clonal haematopoiesis also revealed similar patterns in changes in the methylation and expression of genes associated with OXPHOS 17 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b). Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a +/+ cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). Notably, metformin treatment reversed these aberrant changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in mutant cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

In the context of DNMT3A R882 mutants in which a copy of the wild-type gene remains, the residual DNA methylation activity is estimated to be around 20% of normal, but is not absent 13 . We hypothesized that the metformin-induced increase in methylation index could augment this activity, resulting in a reversal of the aberrant DNA CpG hypomethylation pattern in mutant cells and consequent decrease in their competitive advantage. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that elimination of residual DNMT3A activity by inactivating the remaining wild-type Dnmt3a allele in mutant cells should render them resistant to the effect of metformin. To test this prediction, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a +/+ and Dnmt3a R878H/+ LK cells. The knockout efficiency was approximately 98%, indicative of biallelic inactivation in both cell types (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a). Using our in\u00a0vitro competition assay, we found that Dnmt3a knockout significantly increased the competitive advantage of LK HSPCs, regardless of their initial Dnmt3a genotype (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). Metformin did not suppress the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells following Dnmt3a knockout, supporting the idea that residual DNMT3A activity is required for the metformin effect (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). Another prediction is that metformin treatment should increase the level of methylation at CpG sites that are differentially hypomethylated in Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells. To test this, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) analysis of LK-enriched bone marrow cells from recipient mice that received Dnmt3a R878H/+ or Dnmt3a +/+  WBM cells from sex-matched littermate donors and were either untreated or treated with metformin for 1 month (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c). The RRBS technique, which enriches for CpG-rich regions, was chosen because DNMT3A preferentially catalyses DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. We identified 5,430 DMRs in the comparison between untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 4) and untreated Dnmt3a +/+ ( n = 3) samples. Consistent with prior reports 13,17 , the majority of the DMRs ( n = 4,649; 85.6%) were hypomethylated in the untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04a). In the comparison between metformin-treated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 3) and untreated Dnmt3a R878H/+ ( n = 4) samples, we identified 3,285 DMRs, 1,923\n\n\n\n(58.5%) of which were hypermethylated in the treated samples (Fig.\u00a04a). We found 870 overlapping DMRs at the intersection between these two sets (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c). In line with our hypothesis, metformin treatment increased the methylation level at 617 (90.9%) of the 679 hypomethylated DMRs in Dnmt3a R878H/+ samples, bringing their average methylation levels close to those of untreated Dnmt3a +/+ samples (Fig.\u00a04b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06d). Similar findings were observed in the subsets of DMRs associated with CpG islands and gene promoter regions (Fig.\u00a04a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c,d). To explore the potential effect of these changes in DNA methylation on gene expression, we conducted GSEA on genes ranked by differential promoter methylation and mRNA expression from our bulk RNA-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells, compared with Dnmt3a +/+ cells, exhibited decreased promoter methylation and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). Re-analysis of a previously published combined transcriptome and methylome dataset of single progenitor cells from individuals with DNMT3A R882-mutated clonal haematopoiesis also revealed similar patterns in changes in the methylation and expression of genes associated with OXPHOS 17 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b). Analysis of our bulk RRBS and RNA-seq datasets also showed promoter hypermethylation and decreased expression of genes associated with 1C metabolism in Dnmt3a R878H/+ cells relative to Dnmt3a +/+ cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a).

Chan 1,3 \u2709\n\nClonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses 1-4 . Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot 1-3,5-7 . Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3A R882H/+ , have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration 8 , reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3a R878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3A R882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.\n\nMutations in DNMT3A are the most common genetic alterations in clonal haematopoiesis and are found in between 50% and 60% of clonal haematopoiesis carriers 1-3,5,6 . DNMT3A encodes a de\u00a0novo DNA methyltransferase that catalyses transfer of the methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C5 position of cytosines in DNA, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and production of S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). DNMT3A mutations are classified into those that affect the mutational hotspot at R882 of the DNMT3A protein and those that affect other parts of the gene (non-R882 mutations) 7,9 . Although both types of mutations are predicted to reduce methyltransferase activity, DNMT3A R882 mutations appear to confer a significantly higher risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) compared with non-R882 DNMT3A mutations 10,11 . Thus, DNMT3A R882 mutations represent an important target for preventive intervention.\n\nThe mutations that affect R882 are almost invariably missense alterations and heterozygous 12,13 . DNMT3A R882 mutations have been shown to both reduce the methyltransferase activity of the mutant protein and decrease the activity of the wild-type protein in a dominant-negative manner 13,14 . Consistent with these findings, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in human AML cells or peripheral blood cells with DNMT3A R882 mutations are predominantly hypomethylated compared with their wild-type counterparts 13,15 .\n\nThe effect of DNMT3A mutations on cell fate decisions of HSCs has previously been studied using genetically modified mouse models. In the Dnmt3a R878H/+ mouse model, the mutant HSCs are expanded and have a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs 16 , thus recapitulating a key functional change associated with the mutation in humans. Here we used this model to identify differences in dependencies between\n\nDnmt3a R878H/+ and wild-type HSPCs with the goal of targeting such dependencies to selectively suppress the expansion of mutant HSCs.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Metformin suppresses human mutant HSPCs\n\nTo explore the relevance of our findings in human clonal haematopoiesis, we modelled the DNMT3A R882 mutation in human HSPCs by transducing purified CD34 + HSPCs from cord blood with lentiviral vectors expressing a DNMT3A shRNA and BFP. Since DNMT3A R882-mutated cells retain about 20% of wild-type DNMT3A activity 13 , knockdown of DNMT3A expression should phenocopy the effects of DNMT3A R882 mutations. Using this approach and an in\u00a0vitro competition assay with human cytokines (Fig.\u00a05a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c), we found that DNMT3A -knockdown ( DNMT3A -KD) HSPCs displayed a competitive advantage over control HSPCs expressing a non-targeting shRNA\n\n(shNT) (Fig.\u00a05b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a,b). Consistent with our mouse studies, metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A -KD HSPCs (Fig.\u00a05b). The effects of DNMT3A knockdown and metformin treatment were observed in both the CD34 + and CD34 -cell fractions following ex vivo culture (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c). The suppressive effect of metformin was mitigated by the co-expression of NDI1 (Fig.\u00a05b), indicating that the effect was mediated through inhibition of complex I. DNMT3A -KD HSPCs exhibited higher basal OCRs compared with control HSPCs, a difference that was eliminated by metformin treatment (Fig.\u00a05c). Similar to mouse Dnmt3a R878H HSPCs, the levels of 5mC and H3K27me3 were lower in DNMT3A -KD cells than in control cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e). Metformin treatment augmented the methylation index (Fig.\u00a05f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08d) and increased 5mC and H3K27me3 in DNMT3A -KD cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e), mirroring the mechanistic findings observed in mouse Dnmt3a R878H HSPCs.\n\nTo further evaluate the effect of metformin on DNMT3A R882-mutated human HSPCs, we designed and optimized a prime editing strategy to introduce the R882H mutation into the DNMT3A gene in purified CD34 + HSPCs from cord blood samples. The Cas nickase (nCas)-based prime editing technique has been shown to cause less cytotoxic and genotoxic stress and edit with higher precision and efficiency in long-term repopulating HSPCs than conventional homology-directed repair-based CRISPR-Cas9 editing strategies 26 . Using the optimized prime editing strategy, we introduced the DNMT3A R882H mutation in five HSPC samples from independent donors. As a negative control, we introduced a T&gt;G single nucleotide variant in exon 1 of the B2M gene that causes a premature stop codon 26 . After prime editing, the baseline (day 0) mean variant allele frequency (VAF) was 20% for DNMT3A R882H (Fig.\u00a05g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08e) and 49.8% for the B2M single nucleotide variant (Fig.\u00a05h). The edited cell pools were plated in methylcellulose medium to assess the relative competitive advantage of the DNMT3A R882H versus DNMT3A wild-type cells. After an additional 14 days in culture, the mean VAF of DNMT3A R882H increased to 42.4% in untreated cells, consistent with a relative expansion of the mutant population (Fig.\u00a05g). Metformin treatment suppressed the expansion of DNMT3A -mutated cells with a mean VAF of 26.2% (Fig.\u00a05g). By contrast, the mean VAFs of B2M -edited cells did not significantly change after 14 days in culture with or without metformin treatment (Fig.\u00a05h), indicating that the observed effects on DNMT3A R882H HSPCs were not an artefact of prime editing. Together, these results support the idea that metformin has the potential to suppress the competitive advantage of DNMT3A R882-mutated clones in human clonal haematopoiesis.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer\n\nTo grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines 2 , in\u00a0vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDLcholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates-7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterolwith protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site 3 . The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches 1 . Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive 4 . PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes 5 ; however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread 6-9 . Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis 10-16 , the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Differential organ preference of PDAC cells\n\nHigh-throughput pooled in\u00a0vivo screens using barcoded human cancer cell lines 2 have revealed organ-specific metastasis patterns across tumour types, including PDAC, which frequently spreads to the liver\n\n\n\nand lungs. Using data from these screens (https://depmap.org/metmap/), we calculated fractional seeding ratios for 25 PDAC cell lines across 5 metastatic sites (liver, lung, kidney, brain and bone) (Fig.\u00a01a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b). This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig.\u00a01c). Cluster 1 exhibited a mean liver metastatic potential of 70.6% and penetrance of 37.9%, whereas cluster 2 showed low liver tropism (3.5% potential, 9.8% penetrance) and higher lung affinity (31.2% potential, 51.3% penetrance) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b and Supplementary Table\u00a01).\n\nTo validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections. Intrasplenic injection of KP4 or Panc-1 led to liver tumours within four weeks, whereas HPAC and HPAF-II did not\u00a0grow in the liver (Fig.\u00a01d-g). Conversely, tail vein injection resulted in lung tumours from HPAC and HPAF-II, but not from KP4 or Panc-1 (Fig.\u00a01h-k).

Light-sheet microscopy showed large KP4-R foci and very few HPAC-G foci in the liver, and the reverse was observed in the lungs (Fig.\u00a01m,n and Supplementary Videos\u00a01 and 2).

Using data from these screens (https://depmap.org/metmap/), we calculated fractional seeding ratios for 25 PDAC cell lines across 5 metastatic sites (liver, lung, kidney, brain and bone) (Fig.\u00a01a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b). This analysis identified two PDAC subtypes: one that has a strong preference for liver colonization (cluster 1) and another that favours other organs, notably the lungs (cluster 2) (Fig.\u00a01c). Cluster 1 exhibited a mean liver metastatic potential of 70.6% and penetrance of 37.9%, whereas cluster 2 showed low liver tropism (3.5% potential, 9.8% penetrance) and higher lung affinity (31.2% potential, 51.3% penetrance) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b and Supplementary Table\u00a01).\n\nTo validate the metastatic behaviour of PDAC clusters, we tested four human PDAC cell lines (KP4, Panc-1, HPAC and HPAF-II) for liver and lung colonization using intrasplenic and tail vein injections.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer\n\nTo grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines 2 , in\u00a0vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDLcholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates-7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterolwith protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site 3 . The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches 1 . Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive 4 . PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes 5 ; however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread 6-9 . Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis 10-16 , the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype\n\nPrior transcriptional profiling studies have shown that PDAC can be stratified into two main transcriptional subtypes termed 'basal' and 'classical', which are linked to distinct molecular features and patient prognosis 17-21 . For instance, basal PDAC displays features of poor differentiation, whereas classical PDAC is well-differentiated. We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended h , i , Normalized bioluminescence imaging ( h ) and quantification ( i ) of mice following tail vein (TV) injection of the indicated cluster 1 and cluster 2 cell lines stably expressing luciferase\u00a0( n = 3 mice per cell line). j , k , Representative H&amp;E images showing tumour invasion in the lungs, with lesions outlined in red ( j ) and quantification of per cent tumour area ( k ). n = 6 images per group.

Histological analysis of human PDAC metastases showed that most lung lesions (9 out of 10) were well-differentiated with high nuclear staining for GATA6-a transcription factor associated with the classical subtype 22 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01h-k). By contrast, liver lesions (35 out of 45) were poorly differentiated, lacked GATA6, and showed high nuclear ZEB1 staining (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01h-m and Supplementary Table\u00a03), consistent with basal-like features 20-24 . To test whether subtype determines organ avidity, we utilized CRISPR-mediated gene silencing to knock out GATA6 in HPAC cells. Although this shifted transcriptional profiles from classical to basal (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a,b), GATA6 loss did not affect growth or metastatic colonization (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c-f). Thus, we sought to determine additional parameters, which function in parallel, that may define secondary organ site preference.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

High PCSK9 transcript and protein expression correlated with additional classical subtype markers (CDH1, S100P and FOXQ1) and was inversely correlated with basal markers (ZEB1 and VIM) (Fig.\u00a02b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a,b). PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates cholesterol homeostasis by binding to the LDL receptor (LDLR) and promoting its lysosomal degradation, thereby suppressing LDL import (Fig.\u00a02c). C2-Lung cells showed increased expression and secretion of PCSK9 and reduced total and cell surface levels of LDLR protein (Fig.\u00a02b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03c-e). By contrast, C1-Liver lines had little or no PCSK9 and expressed high total and cell surface LDLR levels (Fig.\u00a02b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d,e). Similarly, mouse PDAC cell lines derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC (referred to as KPC 25 ), showed a similar inverse relationship between PCSK9 and LDLR (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03f), with PCSK9-low lines colonizing the liver and PCSK9-high lines favouring the lung (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03g,h).\n\nTo evaluate expression of PCSK9 and LDLR in primary and metastatic PDAC, we performed immunohistochemical staining of primary specimens from patients with PDAC. Poorly differentiated primary tumours and liver metastases had low expression of PCSK9 and high expression of LDLR, whereas well-differentiated tumours and lung metastases had high PCSK9 expression and low LDLR expression (Fig.\u00a02d-g and Supplementary Tables\u00a04 and 5). We next utilized a matched cohort of primary PDAC from patients who subsequently developed liver (liver cohort) or lung (lung cohort) only metastases 26 (Supplementary Table\u00a06). PDAC tumours from the liver cohort exhibited low PCSK9 and high LDLR staining within the ductal epithelia, whereas tumours from the lung cohort showed high PCSK9 and low LDLR staining (Fig.\u00a02h,i). Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary PDAC and the matched liver metastases 27 further confirmed PCSK9 enrichment in classical\n\n\n\nsubtype clusters and its reduction in liver metastases compared with matched primary tumours (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03i-m). Together these findings link low PCSK9 expression to poor differentiation and liver metastasis, and high PCSK9 expression to well-differentiated PDAC and lung metastasis.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer\n\nTo grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines 2 , in\u00a0vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDLcholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates-7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterolwith protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site 3 . The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches 1 . Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive 4 . PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes 5 ; however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread 6-9 . Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis 10-16 , the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## PCSK9-low liver-avid cells uptake LDL-cholesterol\n\nWe next mechanistically evaluated the functional role of PCSK9 in linking regulation of cholesterol homeostasis to target organ selection and colonization. C1-Liver and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed high\n\nuptake of fluorescently labelled Dil-LDL as measured by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a,b) and immunofluorescence staining of lysosomal localized Dil-LDL (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c-f), relative to C2-Lung PCSK9-high cells, which had minimal uptake. Moreover, filipin staining, which visualizes cellular cholesterol depots, revealed high levels of lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver lines consistent with high cholesterol uptake rates, whereas C2-Lung lines predominantly displayed plasma membrane cholesterol and minimal lysosomal staining (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04g-i). Low PCSK9, high LDL uptake and lysosomal cholesterol was also evident in cells isolated from KPC-derived liver metastases, relative to the matched isogenic primary PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j-n).\n\nLDL uptake was essential for sustaining C1-Liver cell viability but not for C2-Lung cells. Specifically, C1-Liver cells and PCSK9-low KPC cells showed reduced proliferation following 96 h of culture in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS), whereas the growth of C2-Lung lines was unaffected (Fig.\u00a03a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). In response, C1-Liver lines upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes via SCAP-SREBP feedback 28,29 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05b,c); while C2-Lung lines did not (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c,d). Supplementation with exogenous LDL or cholesterol was sufficient to rescue growth of C1-Liver lines grown in LPDS, indicating that loss of LDL-cholesterol is the primary mediator of the observed growth impairment (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e,f).\n\nSimilar to lipoprotein depletion, CRISPR-mediated knockout of LDLR also led to a compensatory upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05g), was selectively detrimental to C1-Liver lines relative to C2-Lung lines (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h-j) and impaired growth of KP4 cells in the liver (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05k,l).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Moreover, DepMap data revealed that high PCSK9 expression correlated with dependency on late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis genes in PDAC (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06h). Accordingly, knockout of FDFT1 and SQLE impaired growth of C2-Lung lines but not C1-Liver lines, which rely on LDL-cholesterol uptake (Fig.\u00a03c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06i-k). All lines were sensitive to HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) knockout, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway, indicating a shared dependence on early mevalonate pathway intermediates (Fig.\u00a03c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06i-k).

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer\n\nTo grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines 2 , in\u00a0vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDLcholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates-7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterolwith protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site 3 . The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches 1 . Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive 4 . PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes 5 ; however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread 6-9 . Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis 10-16 , the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives secondary organ selection\n\nTo test whether PCSK9 levels directly influence organ-specific growth, we first engineered the liver-avid KP4 line to express wild-type PCSK9, a gain-of-function mutant (D374Y) or a loss-of-function variant (R46L) 31,32 (Fig.\u00a03e). Wild-type PCSK9 and PCSK9(D374Y) caused a decrease in LDLR levels (Fig.\u00a03e), decreased LDL uptake (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a,b) and a shift towards de\u00a0novo cholesterol biosynthesis, as evidenced by increased expression of mevalonate pathway enzymes (Fig.\u00a03e). When transplanted into the liver or lungs, parental KP4 cells and KP4 cells expressing PCSK9(R46L) developed large tumours in the liver over a period of four to five weeks, whereas cells expressing wild-type PCSK9 or PCSK9(D374Y) exhibited reduced growth in the liver over the same time frame (Fig.\u00a03f,g). Notably, whereas parental KP4 cells did not grow in the lungs, PCSK9(D374Y)-expressing cells were able to grow in the lungs (Fig.\u00a03f,h).\n\nWe next tested whether knockout of PCSK9 or overexpression of LDLR in a C2-Lung line, HPAC, was sufficient to enable growth within the liver. CRISPR-mediated knockout of PCSK9 increased the amount of LDLR protein and LDL uptake and reduced cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression (Fig.\u00a03i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c,d) without affecting in\u00a0vitro growth (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07e). However, upon tail vein injection, PCSK9-knockout cells displayed reduced growth in the lungs and enhanced growth in the liver relative to control HPAC cells treated with non-targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Fig.\u00a03j-l). Similarly, overexpression of LDLR in HPAC cells phenocopied PCSK9 suppression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f-i) and led to increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07j,k). Finally, CRISPR-mediated Pcsk9 knockout in mouse PDAC cells transplanted into syngeneic hosts also lead to decreased growth in the lungs and increased growth in the liver (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07l-s), with no effect on primary pancreatic tumour growth (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07t,u). These findings support a model whereby PCSK9-LDLR status and the associated cholesterol uptake versus synthesis are necessary and sufficient to determine whether PDAC cells grow in the liver or the lungs, respectively.\n\nOur findings show that baseline levels of PCSK9 predict secondary organ preference, especially in patients with liver-only or lung-only metastases (see Fig.\u00a02h). However, PCSK9-high and PCSK9-low cells can coexist within the same primary tumour (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a,b). Since PDAC cells can reach both the liver and lungs regardless of PCSK9 status (see Fig.\u00a01l-n), we tested whether PCSK9 expression still predicts colonization in heterogenous tumours. Using mouse MT23 cells (shown in Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j), which form primary tumours with variable PCSK9 expression, we found that liver metastases uniformly expressed low PCSK9, whereas lung metastases showed high expression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a,b). These results confirm that PCSK9 status reliably predicts organ-specific colonization and tumour burden in the liver or the lungs.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells\n\nWe next sought to determine the fate of the LDL-cholesterol actively taken up by C1-Liver cells, and its specific role in promoting survival and colonization of the liver. Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1\u00a0(refs.\u00a033,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig.\u00a04b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig\u00a04a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling. Consistent with this model, DepMap reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data confirmed a positive correlation between liver colonization potential and mTOR activity (Fig.\u00a04c), and patient liver metastases had higher phosphorylated S6 than lung lesions (Fig.\u00a04d). Conversely, high PCSK9 mRNA levels correlated with lower mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09d), supporting a model in which low PCSK9 promotes liver growth via LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake and mTORC1 activation.\n\nFollowing its export from the lysosome, cholesterol can be partly converted to oxysterols by the action of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. In turn, release of oxysterols relieves potential cholesterol overload in the producing cells and can exert modulatory functions on the surrounding tissue, including effects that promote tumour growth and metastasis 35 . We therefore assessed whether C1-Liver cells express enzymes required for oxysterol production. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) revealed that the mRNA level of CYP46A1 , which encodes a cholesterol hydroxylase that synthesizes 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), was upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PDAC dataset (Fig.\u00a04e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09e,f). Other cholesterol hydroxylases showed no correlation with PCSK9 status (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09g), suggesting a specific role for CYP46A1 in C1-Liver cells. In support of this idea, high CYP46A1 expression was correlated with increased liver invasion potential in PDAC cells (Fig.\u00a04f).\n\nStudies in the brain have shown that 24-HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) 36,37 . Given that hepatocytes are the primary source of LDL-cholesterol synthesis in the liver, we tested whether an analogous tumour-hepatocyte circuit may also exist during colonization of the liver. To do so, we measured activation of LXR target genes in primary mouse hepatocytes following incubation for 24 h with conditioned medium isolated from KP4 (C1-Liver) or HPAC (C2-Lung) cells (Fig.\u00a04g). Only conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes ( ABCA1 , ABCG1 , LXRA , PLTP , SREBF1 and APOE ) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04h). Similarly, treatment with KP4-conditioned medium but not HPAC-conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4-conditioned medium in hepatocytes.\n\nThe ability of KP4-conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1\n\n(Extended Data Fig.\u00a09i-k). Accordingly, addition of exogenous 24-HC was able to rescue LXR target gene expression in hepatocytes treated with medium conditioned by CYP46A1-knockout KP4 cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09j). To assess whether LXR activation occurs in hepatocytes in\u00a0vivo, tumour-adjacent and non-adjacent sections from liver metastases were stained for the LXR transcriptional target ABCA1 (Fig.\u00a04i), a cholesterol exporter belonging to the ABC family of transporters. Tumour-adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non-adjacent hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04j,k), suggesting that hepatocytes in proximity to tumour cells activate LXR target gene expression to a\n\nhigher degree than non-adjacent hepatocytes. These data suggest that C1-Liver derived 24-HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed-forward manner to support continued LDL-cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth. Consistent with this idea, CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in\u00a0vitro proliferation, whereas lung growth remained low and unchanged (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09l-o). Thus, CYP46A1-mediated oxysterol signalling promotes liver-specific growth. Overall, increased LDL uptake in C1-Liver cells supports mTORC1-mediated growth and production of oxysterols that enhance the tumour-supportive niche.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Lysosomal cholesterol is a critical mediator of proliferative signalling via activation of the master nutrient sensor mTORC1\u00a0(refs.\u00a033,34). Filipin staining confirmed high lysosomal cholesterol in C1-Liver cells, which was reduced by lipoprotein depletion (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a), leading to reduced phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1 (Fig.\u00a04b). By contrast, C2-Lung lines, which lack measurable lysosomal cholesterol stores, maintained mTORC1 signalling independent of exogenous lipoprotein (Fig\u00a04a,b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a). However, PCSK9 knockout in the C2-Lung line HPAC restored LDL uptake and made mTORC1 activation lipoprotein-dependent in these cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09b). Additionally, liver tumours derived from PCSK9-knockout HPAC cells showed higher mTORC1 activity relative to equivalent tumours growing in the lungs, as shown by immunofluorescence staining of tumour sections for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (a downstream target of mTORC1) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09c). These data indicate that a function of PCSK9-low status and subsequent LDL-cholesterol uptake and lysosomal routing is to maintain proliferative competence in C1-Liver lines, at least in part by sustaining pro-growth mTORC1 signalling. Consistent with this model, DepMap reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data confirmed a positive correlation between liver colonization potential and mTOR activity (Fig.\u00a04c), and patient liver metastases had higher phosphorylated S6 than lung lesions (Fig.\u00a04d). Conversely, high PCSK9 mRNA levels correlated with lower mTOR activity (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09d), supporting a model in which low PCSK9 promotes liver growth via LDLR-mediated cholesterol uptake and mTORC1 activation.\n\nFollowing its export from the lysosome, cholesterol can be partly converted to oxysterols by the action of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. In turn, release of oxysterols relieves potential cholesterol overload in the producing cells and can exert modulatory functions on the surrounding tissue, including effects that promote tumour growth and metastasis 35 . We therefore assessed whether C1-Liver cells express enzymes required for oxysterol production. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) revealed that the mRNA level of CYP46A1 , which encodes a cholesterol hydroxylase that synthesizes 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), was upregulated in C1-Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PDAC dataset (Fig.\u00a04e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09e,f). Other cholesterol hydroxylases showed no correlation with PCSK9 status (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09g), suggesting a specific role for CYP46A1 in C1-Liver cells. In support of this idea, high CYP46A1 expression was correlated with increased liver invasion potential in PDAC cells (Fig.\u00a04f).\n\nStudies in the brain have shown that 24-HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) 36,37 . Given that hepatocytes are the primary source of LDL-cholesterol synthesis in the liver, we tested whether an analogous tumour-hepatocyte circuit may also exist during colonization of the liver. To do so, we measured activation of LXR target genes in primary mouse hepatocytes following incubation for 24 h with conditioned medium isolated from KP4 (C1-Liver) or HPAC (C2-Lung) cells (Fig.\u00a04g). Only conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes ( ABCA1 , ABCG1 , LXRA , PLTP , SREBF1 and APOE ) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig.\u00a04h). Similarly, treatment with KP4-conditioned medium but not HPAC-conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4-conditioned medium in hepatocytes.\n\nThe ability of KP4-conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1\n\n(Extended Data Fig.\u00a09i-k). Accordingly, addition of exogenous 24-HC was able to rescue LXR target gene expression in hepatocytes treated with medium conditioned by CYP46A1-knockout KP4 cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09j). To assess whether LXR activation occurs in hepatocytes in\u00a0vivo, tumour-adjacent and non-adjacent sections from liver metastases were stained for the LXR transcriptional target ABCA1 (Fig.\u00a04i), a cholesterol exporter belonging to the ABC family of transporters.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer\n\nTo grow at distant sites, metastatic cells must overcome major challenges posed by the unique cellular and metabolic composition of secondary organs 1 . Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that metastasizes to the liver and lungs. Despite evidence of metabolic reprogramming away from the primary site, the key drivers that dictate the ability of PDAC cells to colonize the liver or lungs and survive there remain undefined. Here we identified PCSK9 as predictive of liver versus lung colonization by integrating metastatic tropism data of human PDAC cell lines 2 , in\u00a0vivo metastasis modelling in mice and gene expression correlation analysis. PCSK9 negatively regulates low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol import and, accordingly, PCSK9-low PDAC cells preferentially colonize LDL-rich liver tissue. LDLcholesterol taken up by liver-avid PCSK9-low cells supports activation of pro-growth mTORC1 activation at the lysosome, and through conversion into the signalling oxysterol, 24( S )-hydroxycholesterol, reprogrammes the microenvironment to release nutrients from neighbouring hepatocytes. Conversely, PCSK9-high, lung-avid PDAC cells rely on transcriptional upregulation of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway to generate intermediates-7-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrodesmosterolwith protective action against ferroptosis, a vulnerability in the oxygen-rich microenvironment of the lung. Increasing the amount of PCSK9 redirected liver-avid cells to the lung whereas ablating PCSK9 drove lung-avid cells to the liver, thereby establishing PCSK9 as necessary and sufficient for secondary organ site preference. Our studies reveal PCSK9-driven differential utilization of the distal cholesterol synthesis pathway as a key and potentially actionable driver of metastatic growth in PDAC.\n\nMetastatic colonization requires tumour cells to adapt to microenvironments that differ from their primary site 3 . The mechanisms that enable outgrowth in secondary organs with distinct nutrient, cellular and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. Metabolic plasticity of tumour cells is key to survival in circulation and adaptation to new niches 1 . Similarly, the metabolic profile of the target organ imposes selective pressure, allowing only suitably adapted cells to thrive 4 . PDAC frequently metastasizes to the liver, lungs, peritoneum and lymph nodes 5 ; however, the specific target organ has relevance for disease progression, with lung-only metastases being linked to better outcomes than liver or multi-site spread 6-9 . Although several pathways have been associated with PDAC metastasis 10-16 , the determinants of organ preference and niche-specific growth remain unclear. Here we show that PCSK9 regulates the availability of specific cholesterol intermediates and derivatives, which help tumour cells overcome organ-specific challenges associated with growth in the liver and lung.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells\n\nFinally, we sought to determine how increased de\u00a0novo synthesis of cholesterol intermediates driven by high PCSK9 levels contributes to lung colonization by PDAC cells. Recent studies have shown that resistance to ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of cell death involving phospholipid peroxidation 38 -is mediated by several late-step cholesterol synthesis intermediates including squalene 39 and 7-dehydrocholesterol\n\n(7-DHC) 40-42 . The 5,7-diene B ring structure of 7-DHC functions as a radical-trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis 40-42 , and sterols with similar structural features, such as 7-dehydrodesmosterol (7-DHD), also have anti-ferroptotic capabilities (Fig.\u00a05a). High expression of sterol C5-desaturase (SC5D), 7-DHC reductase (DHCR7) and DHCR24 expression, along with several other distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway enzymes, positively correlated with PCSK9-high status in samples from patients with PDAC (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010a) and in C2-Lung\n\nlines (see Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7-DHC and 7-DHD in HPAC (C2-Lung) versus KP4 (C1-Liver) cells (Fig.\u00a05b,c) and expression of active PCSK9 (D374Y) in KP4 cells was sufficient to increase the levels of these sterols (Fig.\u00a05d,e).\n\nTo test whether cholesterol biosynthesis influences ferroptosis sensitivity, we treated C1-Liver and C2-Lung PDAC lines with the GPX4 inhibitors RSL3 and ML210. C2-Lung lines were collectively more resistant, showing higher mean half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) values relative to C1-Liver lines (Fig.\u00a05f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a010b). Similarly, HPAC cells were relatively resistant to RSL3 treatment (Fig.\u00a05g,h). Accordingly, HPAC cells resisted RSL3-induced death, as measured by SYTOX Green, whereas KP4 cells were highly sensitive-an effect that was reversed by adding exogenous 7-DHC or 7-DHD but not desmosterol (Fig.\u00a05g, j). Addition of the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid enhanced RSL3-induced cell death in both KP4 and HPAC cells, but to a greater extent in KP4 cells (Fig.\u00a05g-i). These findings suggest that intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2-Lung cells from oxidative stress. Accordingly, knockout of PCSK9, or blocking the synthesis of 7-DHC and 7-DHD following knockout of SC5D, sensitized HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010c-e) and reduced lung colonization (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010f,g).\n\nIn KP4 cells, expression of dominant active PCSK9(D374Y), which causes a shift towards cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a03e), reduced sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010h). Knockout of SC5D had no effect, consistent with the reduced reliance on sterol biosynthesis in these cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010i,j). Notably, pre-treatment of liver-avid KPC1 cells with 7-DHC or 7-DHD for 24 h in\u00a0vitro\u00a0was sufficient to enhance lung colonization following tail vein injection (Fig.\u00a05j,k).\n\nConsistent with these findings, unbiased analysis of CRISPR dependency data across 1,005 cancer cell lines showed that PCSK9-low status is strongly associated with sensitivity to GPX4 loss and several additional ferroptosis-protective genes (Fig.\u00a05l) as well as GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010k). Together, these findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Together, these findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti-ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death.", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/pcsk9.md"}

Kvon 1 \u2709\n\nAlthough most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in\u00a0vivo enhancerreplacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and mediumrange limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis -acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals 3-7 . Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances 1,2,8-10 . Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer 8,11-14 .\n\nA central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood 1,15 . Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs) 16-20 . However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression 21-25 . Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs 26-31 . Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood 1,13,15,32 . Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.\n\nHere we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively\n\nabolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range\n\nTo test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice 2 . Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb 33 . Owing to the clear phenotypic readout and lack of redundancy, ZRS-Shh\n\nis an ideal locus for assessing the long-range enhancer activity of transplanted enhancers.\n\nTo perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression in the developing limb bud mesenchyme (MM1492 and MM1564 (from mouse) and HS1516 and HS72 (from human); Fig.\u00a01a,b). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA, a posterior domain of the limb mesenchyme where ZRS activates Shh gene expression (Fig.\u00a01b). All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by acetylation at lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27ac) in limb buds, a histone modification that is associated with active enhancers (Fig.\u00a01a). To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) multiome profiling of 14,000 cells from a wild-type (WT) embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) hindlimb bud (Methods). After clustering all 14,000 cells on the basis of their chromatin and gene expression profiles, we annotated 16 clusters representing all major cell types in the developing limb bud (Methods, Extended Data Fig.\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a01). The HS72, HS1516 and\n\n\n\nMM1492 enhancers display strong DNA accessibility in Shh positive ZPA cells, consistent with their ability to drive robust reporter expression in posterior limb mesenchyme in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig.\u00a01a).\n\nTo link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, we used the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from multiome profiling and E-P physical interaction data based on tissue-resolved high-resolution enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Methods). We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (mouse homologue of HS1516) (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (mouse homologue of HS72) (411 kb away) (Fig.\u00a01c). We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos. This analysis confirmed the above E-P links and additionally identified Rbms1 as a putative target for MM1564 (177 kb away; Fig.\u00a01b,c).\n\nWe next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig.\u00a01d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a,b) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig.\u00a01e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in\u00a0vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology in E18.5 KI mice. Consistent with the loss of limb-specific Shh expression, all four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. The limb phenotypes were indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence of similar length (Fig.\u00a01e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c). These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh -mediated limb development.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC-seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRS HS72 and ZRS HS1516 KI alleles.\n\nHS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC-seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03). ZRS HS72 and ZRS HS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig.\u00a02a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting\u00a0the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Kvon 1 \u2709\n\nAlthough most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in\u00a0vivo enhancerreplacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and mediumrange limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis -acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals 3-7 . Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances 1,2,8-10 . Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer 8,11-14 .\n\nA central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood 1,15 . Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs) 16-20 . However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression 21-25 . Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs 26-31 . Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood 1,13,15,32 . Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.\n\nHere we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively\n\nabolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range\n\nThe inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising, given their robust enhancer features and ability to establish open chromatin at the transplanted location. Previously, all four limb enhancers were characterized in transgenic mice using a well-established hsp68 minimal promoter, but their compatibility with the Shh promoter is unclear. To test whether E-P incompatibility 36,37 could have a role in the observed differences in gene activation, we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct into fertilized mouse eggs. All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs.\u00a01a and\u00a02b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in\u00a0vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter 38-40 .\n\nTo test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig.\u00a02c\u00a0and\u00a0Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb 2,41 . As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, Shh HS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de\u00a0novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity 42 (Fig.\u00a02c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72:: Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a). Importantly, ZRS HS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig.\u00a01c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig.\u00a01c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig.\u00a03a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs.\u00a01b and 2b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig.\u00a03b).\n\nConsistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRS HS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig.\u00a03b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). ZRS HS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs.\u00a01b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a-c).\n\nNotably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse\n\nembryos (Fig.\u00a03c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig.\u00a01c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig.\u00a01c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig.\u00a03a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs.\u00a01b and 2b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig.\u00a03b).\n\nConsistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRS HS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig.\u00a03b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). ZRS HS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs.\u00a01b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a-c).\n\nNotably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer.

Kvon 1 \u2709\n\nAlthough most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in\u00a0vivo enhancerreplacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and mediumrange limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis -acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals 3-7 . Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances 1,2,8-10 . Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer 8,11-14 .\n\nA central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood 1,15 . Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs) 16-20 . However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression 21-25 . Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs 26-31 . Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood 1,13,15,32 . Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.\n\nHere we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively\n\nabolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## REX is sufficient for long-range activation\n\nTo test whether the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers, we generated a KI mouse line in which the ZRS was replaced with a chimeric element consisting of the shortest-range heterologous limb enhancer from our test set (MM1492, 73 kb native E-P range) appended by the REX element (MM1492 + REX; Extended Data Fig.\u00a05d). KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRS MM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig.\u00a03d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e). These mice also displayed polydactyly, consistent with broad limb activity of MM1492. Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing\n\nthem at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation. These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06j). We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a).\n\nTo determine the importance of LHX and LEF1 motifs for REX function, we generated two KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with the extended HS72 sequence containing the REX element with either the\n\nsingle LEF1 motif or both LHX motifs mutagenized. Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly indicating that disruption of the LEF1 motif does not abolish long-range activity of the REX element (Fig.\u00a04b). However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig.\u00a04c and Extended Data Fig. 6b).

Kvon 1 \u2709\n\nAlthough most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range 1 . The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer-promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in\u00a0vivo enhancerreplacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and mediumrange limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis -acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1 . The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh 2 . The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.\n\nTranscriptional enhancers are abundant cis -acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals 3-7 . Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances 1,2,8-10 . Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer 8,11-14 .\n\nA central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood 1,15 . Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions by restricting E-P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs) 16-20 . However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E-P communication and gene expression 21-25 . Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs 26-31 . Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E-P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood 1,13,15,32 . Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.\n\nHere we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively\n\nabolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## LHX motifs are enriched in remote enhancers\n\nTo investigate whether the LHX or other TF motifs are present at longrange limb enhancers, we used a collection of experimentally validated\n\nlimb enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a unique resource of human and mouse enhancers with in\u00a0vivo activities characterized in transgenic mice 43 . We linked these bona fide limb enhancers to their putative target genes using the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from our single-cell ATAC-seq (scATACseq)\u00a0and\u00a0scRNA-seq experiment or E-P physical interactions from enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01d). We next performed motif analysis of these limb enhancers. We found 33 motifs that match the binding preferences of limb-expressed TFs that are significantly enriched in long-range acting (173 regions; E-P distance, 400 kb to 2 Mb) compared to short-range acting (28 regions; E-P distance, 10-200 kb) enhancer regions (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P &lt; 1 \u00d7 10 -2 and target frequency &gt; 30%), with LHX2 and LHX9 being among the most significantly enriched (Fig.\u00a04d, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e\n\nand Supplementary Table\u00a02). Overall, HD TFs with a similar [C/T]AATTA consensus binding preference, including DLX5, MSX2 and SHOX2, comprised 10 out of these 33 motifs. By contrast, short-range limb enhancers showed no enrichment for TF motifs over long-range enhancers.\n\nWe next examined all 19,276 limb mesenchyme E-P pairs predicted from our scATAC-seq/scRNA-seq experiment (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c and Supplementary Table\u00a02). Genome wide, the LHX2 motif was among the most significantly enriched in long-range versus short-range limb enhancers (CTAATTA, P &lt; 6 \u00d7 10 -32 ). Overall, [C/T]AATTA HD motifs, including both LHX2 and LHX9 motifs, comprised 15 out of the top 20 most significantly enriched motifs in long-range limb enhancers.\n\nThe REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long range enhancer activity (Fig.\u00a04a,c). To test whether having more than one [C/T] AATTA motif could be characteristic of other long-range enhancers,\n\nwe examined the number of [C/T]AATTA motifs in experimentally validated and multiome-predicted limb enhancers (Methods). Indeed, for limb enhancers containing more than one [C/T]AATTA motif the enhancer regions were on average 429 kb farther (median distance) from their target promoters than other limb enhancers ( P &lt; 0.01; Fig.\u00a04e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06f-i). Taken together, these results indicate that conserved [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are enriched in long-distance limb enhancers throughout the genome and are frequently located within the conserved core of enhancers themselves (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06k).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.\n\nHere we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T] AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E-P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively\n\nabolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E-P distance.

The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## LHX motifs are critical for ZRS activity\n\nWe next examined whether [C/T]AATTA motifs located inside enhancers are specifically required for their long-range enhancer activity. The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T]\n\nAATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig.\u00a05a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse 44 . We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRS\u2206HD), drives eGFP . The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig.\u00a05a). We injected the resulting ZRS-mCherry/ZRS\u2206HD-eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig.\u00a05b,c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c,d).\n\nWe obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig.\u00a05c). While both the ZRS and ZRS\u2206HD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRS\u2206HD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity 45 . Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP , indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation ( P &lt; 0.0182; Fig.\u00a05c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b).\n\nHaving established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E-P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb\n\noutgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs.\u00a01d and 5d).

The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T]\n\nAATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig.\u00a05a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse 44 . We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRS\u2206HD), drives eGFP . The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig.\u00a05a). We injected the resulting ZRS-mCherry/ZRS\u2206HD-eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig.\u00a05b,c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c,d).\n\nWe obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig.\u00a05c). While both the ZRS and ZRS\u2206HD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRS\u2206HD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity 45 . Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP , indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation ( P &lt; 0.0182; Fig.\u00a05c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b).\n\nHaving established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E-P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T] AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb\n\noutgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs.\u00a01d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRS \u2206HD/\u2206HD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRS\u2206HD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig.\u00a05e).\n\nTaken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T] AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity.

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T\u00a0cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors\n\nTo characterize the impact of lung adenocarcinoma growth on myelopoiesis, we profiled progenitors and myeloid lineages in BM of naive and Kras LSL-G12D/+ ;Trp53 fl/fl (KP) tumour-bearing mice modelling non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at early (day 7), middle (day 15) and advanced (day 21) time points. We observed a marked increase in long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic-monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by\n\n1 Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 2 Department of Immunology and Immunotherapy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 3 Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 4 Institut Gustave Roussy, INSERM U1015, Villejuif, France. 5 The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 6 Department of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 7 Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. 8 Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis Program, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, New York, NY, USA. 9 Laboratory of Epigenetics and Immunity, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.  10 The Human Immune Monitoring Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 11 Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 12 Center for Thoracic Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. 13 These authors contributed equally: Bruno Giotti, Brian Y.

BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic-monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01b,c). In addition, we observed an increased mobilization of Ly6C hi monocytes and Ly6G hi neutrophils in circulation tracking with tumour burden (Extended Data Figs.\u00a01d naive mice; ranked by false discovery rate (FDR).

We also observed an expansion of GMP-derived CD157 + Ly6C hi neutrophil-like monocytes in the BM and peripheral blood of late-stage tumour-bearing mice (Fig.\u00a01b), previously described to expand in emergency conditions and engender oxidative burst-associated degranulation gene programs 9,10 . We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes in the Kras LSL-G12D/+ ;Trp53 fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c).\n\nGiven that such myeloid expansion is driven by malignancy, we probed how molecular programs are transcriptionally and epigenetically rewired in myeloid progenitors in response to peripheral tumour cues. Experimentally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate myeloid progenitor lineages broadly sorted from the BM of age-matched naive and advanced tumour-bearing mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d). We identified distinct granulocytic (granulocytic progenitor, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil)\u00a0and monocytic (cMoP, Ly6C hi monocyte, Ly6C low monocyte) lineages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Table\u00a02). We focused on monocytic lineage progenitors (GMP and cMoP) because they are the main source of suppressive mo-macs in tumours 11 . Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as 'response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'hypoxia response', 'regulation of apoptosis' and 'metabolic regulation of superoxide generation', which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis 12,13 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01g,h). Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6C hi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a01) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a01d).\n\nUsing scRNA-seq profiles of myeloid cells with paired small-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we then correlated gene programs in each myeloid cell state to chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01i) and focused on transcription factors (TF) driving downstream gene programs. Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions included GATA2, TAL1 and LYL1 (ref. 14), whereas cMoPs and monocyte marker regions were enriched in IRF4 and SPIB 15 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01j). We then sought to identify TF motifs enriched in differentially accessible regions of tumour-associated cell states. In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as NFE2L2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (ref. 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA 17 (Fig.\u00a01e), when compared with naive counterparts. These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&amp;RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig.\u00a01f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01k). Enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal augmented in tumour-associated GMPs was associated with pathways involved in cellular detoxification, immunoregulation and anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01l). Domains of regulatory chromatin (DORC) scores calculated on H3K4me3 signal-gene association highlighted genes involved in inflammation regulation (for example, S100a8 , S100a9 , Hif1a , Chil3 , Lcn2 and Prtn3 ), metabolic adaptation under oxidative stress (for example, Hk3 , Eif5a , Pkm , Gpi1 , Gsr and Aldh2 ) and mitogen-induced survival (for example, Anxa3 , Tnfrsf1a and Serpinb1a ) activated in KP-experienced GMPs (Fig.\u00a01g and Methods). On the other hand, we observed a reduction of type I or III interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression in tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors, supporting a dampened inflammatory state 18,19 distal to the TME (Fig.\u00a01c). The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs including IRF3, IRF7, IRF5 and STAT2 (Fig.\u00a01e), lower H3K4me3-associated DORC scores at IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) loci such as Ifi203 , Oasl1 and Isg15 (Fig.\u00a01g) and lower H3K4me1-associated and H3K27ac-associated DORC scores complemented by higher H3K27me3 repressive histone mark at gene loci such as Ifitm3 , Ms4a4c , Mx1 and Gbp4 in tumoural BM myeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01m) further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity. These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response 20 , mitochondria-ER metabolic adaptations 21 and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion 22 . We identified certain binding motifs for TFs such as Nfe2l2 to be enriched in promoter-proximal activating histone marks of tumoural myeloid progenitors, unlike TFs such as Gata2 , Mesp1 , Glis2 and Tcf3 that are enriched at more distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enhancer-associated signal (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01n).\n\nSubsequently, we quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC and found that HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC when compared with healthy donors (Fig.\u00a01h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02e). We next conducted a 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with NSCLC, to interrogate molecular changes. Mirroring our findings in mice, CD14 + monocytes from peripheral blood of patients with early NSCLC had increased oxidative stress response signature scores (Fig.\u00a01i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01o) and accessible chromatin topics enriched in these patients were associated with 'MAPK signalling activation', 'metabolic processes', 'response to ROS' and 'response to oxidative stress' (Fig.\u00a01j and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01p). In support, genes differentially expressed in monocytes from patients with NSCLC were downstream of TF regulators such as NFE2L2, STAT3, PPARG and MYC (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01q). Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

BM progenitors from late-stage tumour-bearing mice formed markedly more granulocytic-monocytic colonies than erythroid colonies and proliferated more than their tumour-naive counterparts (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01b,c). In addition, we observed an increased mobilization of Ly6C hi monocytes and Ly6G hi neutrophils in circulation tracking with tumour burden (Extended Data Figs.\u00a01d naive mice; ranked by false discovery rate (FDR).

We also observed an expansion of GMP-derived CD157 + Ly6C hi neutrophil-like monocytes in the BM and peripheral blood of late-stage tumour-bearing mice (Fig.\u00a01b), previously described to expand in emergency conditions and engender oxidative burst-associated degranulation gene programs 9,10 . We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes in the Kras LSL-G12D/+ ;Trp53 fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c).\n\nGiven that such myeloid expansion is driven by malignancy, we probed how molecular programs are transcriptionally and epigenetically rewired in myeloid progenitors in response to peripheral tumour cues. Experimentally, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to interrogate myeloid progenitor lineages broadly sorted from the BM of age-matched naive and advanced tumour-bearing mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02d). We identified distinct granulocytic (granulocytic progenitor, pre-neutrophil, immature neutrophil)\u00a0and monocytic (cMoP, Ly6C hi monocyte, Ly6C low monocyte) lineages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Table\u00a02). We focused on monocytic lineage progenitors (GMP and cMoP) because they are the main source of suppressive mo-macs in tumours 11 . Differentially upregulated genes in tumour-educated GMPs and cMoPs were associated with biological processes such as 'response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'hypoxia response', 'regulation of apoptosis' and 'metabolic regulation of superoxide generation', which was supported in other datasets of tumour-driven myelopoiesis 12,13 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01g,h). Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6C hi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a01) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a01d).\n\nUsing scRNA-seq profiles of myeloid cells with paired small-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we then correlated gene programs in each myeloid cell state to chromatin accessibility (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01i) and focused on transcription factors (TF) driving downstream gene programs. Lineage-determining TF motifs enriched in GMP marker regions included GATA2, TAL1 and LYL1 (ref. 14), whereas cMoPs and monocyte marker regions were enriched in IRF4 and SPIB 15 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01j). We then sought to identify TF motifs enriched in differentially accessible regions of tumour-associated cell states. In line with our transcriptional results, tumour-associated GMPs and cMoPs had increased motif accessibility for oxidative stress-responsive TFs such as NFE2L2, BACH1, FOSL2, ATF4, ATF5, NFIL3, STAT3 and XBP1 (ref. 16), AP-1 factors such as JUND, JUN and FOS, and granulocytic fate regulators CEBPB and CEBPA 17 (Fig.\u00a01e), when compared with naive counterparts. These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&amp;RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig.\u00a01f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01k). Enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signal augmented in tumour-associated GMPs was associated with pathways involved in cellular detoxification, immunoregulation and anti-apoptotic or pro-survival pathways (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01l). Domains of regulatory chromatin (DORC) scores calculated on H3K4me3 signal-gene association highlighted genes involved in inflammation regulation (for example, S100a8 , S100a9 , Hif1a , Chil3 , Lcn2 and Prtn3 ), metabolic adaptation under oxidative stress (for example, Hk3 , Eif5a , Pkm , Gpi1 , Gsr and Aldh2 ) and mitogen-induced survival (for example, Anxa3 , Tnfrsf1a and Serpinb1a ) activated in KP-experienced GMPs (Fig.\u00a01g and Methods). On the other hand, we observed a reduction of type I or III interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression in tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors, supporting a dampened inflammatory state 18,19 distal to the TME (Fig.\u00a01c). The reduced chromatin accessibility for several IFN pathway TFs including IRF3, IRF7, IRF5 and STAT2 (Fig.\u00a01e), lower H3K4me3-associated DORC scores at IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) loci such as Ifi203 , Oasl1 and Isg15 (Fig.\u00a01g) and lower H3K4me1-associated and H3K27ac-associated DORC scores complemented by higher H3K27me3 repressive histone mark at gene loci such as Ifitm3 , Ms4a4c , Mx1 and Gbp4 in tumoural BM myeloid progenitors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01m) further supported our transcriptomic findings of IFN hyposensitivity. These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response 20 , mitochondria-ER metabolic adaptations 21 and IFN hypo-responsiveness to limit exhaustion 22 . We identified certain binding motifs for TFs such as Nfe2l2 to be enriched in promoter-proximal activating histone marks of tumoural myeloid progenitors, unlike TFs such as Gata2 , Mesp1 , Glis2 and Tcf3 that are enriched at more distal H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enhancer-associated signal (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01n).\n\nSubsequently, we quantified mobilized progenitor populations in the blood of patients with early-stage NSCLC and found that HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and GMPs were elevated in peripheral blood from patients with early-stage NSCLC when compared with healthy donors (Fig.\u00a01h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02e). We next conducted a 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) assay on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with NSCLC, to interrogate molecular changes. Mirroring our findings in mice, CD14 + monocytes from peripheral blood of patients with early NSCLC had increased oxidative stress response signature scores (Fig.\u00a01i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01o) and accessible chromatin topics enriched in these patients were associated with 'MAPK signalling activation', 'metabolic processes', 'response to ROS' and 'response to oxidative stress' (Fig.\u00a01j and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01p). In support, genes differentially expressed in monocytes from patients with NSCLC were downstream of TF regulators such as NFE2L2, STAT3, PPARG and MYC (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01q). Thus, cancer-associated inflammation provokes demand-adapted mobilization of myeloid-biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress-responsive epigenomic remodelling.", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/myeloid.md"}

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T\u00a0cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs\n\nTo measure whether imprinting of stress-responsive programs in BM myeloid progenitors upon sensing systemic tumour cues influence mo-mac states in the TME, we adoptively transferred GMPs from either tumour-bearing mice or naive mice into a tumour-bearing congenic host (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02f). We found mo-macs derived from tumour-primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB + CD9 + TREM2 hi mo-macs 23 expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1 + mo-macs 24 and decreased frequency of CD86 + MHCII +  immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig.\u00a02a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a-c). In addition, we differentiated BM-derived macrophage (BMDM) ex vivo in the presence of tumour conditioning (CM) either early or later during the differentiation. Early exposure to tumour inflammatory cues significantly enhanced mo-mac suppressive phenotype compared with late exposure (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d). Transient incubation of BM progenitors with KP CM also cued a more immunoregulatory phenotype in progeny macrophages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03e). These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\n\nUsing paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis of myeloid cells isolated from naive and tumour-bearing lungs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02g), we identified discrete inflammatory Ly6C hi monocytes, patrolling Ly6C low monocytes, resident tissue alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and mo-mac subsets such as ARG1 hi mo-macs and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a). Using gene-gene correlation, we identified a module of genes implicated in anti-apoptotic cytoprotection, glycolytic metabolic shift and regulation of oxidative stress that was highly enriched in tumour-infiltrating ARG1 hi mo-macs and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b, Supplementary Table\u00a02 and Methods), regulated by TFs such as STAT3 , NFE2L2 , HIF1A , KLF4 , SPI1 and CEBPB . We captured a similar diversity of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the scATAC-seq data through independent clustering of chromatin accessibility features (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c), which aligned with cell-type-specific enrichment of lineage-determining TF motifs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d). TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2 , Fosl2 and Bach1 , were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1 hi and TREM2 hi mo-macs. Phenotypically, Ly6C hi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended\n\nData Fig.\u00a03f) and intratumoural TREM2 hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03g). In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\n\nWe simultaneously used paired single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling to analyse tumour-infiltrating immune cells isolated from 14 human NSCLC lesions (Supplementary Table\u00a03). On the basis of marker gene-based filtering in our 10x Multiome dataset from 5 patients, we isolated 4,177 myeloid cells and classified them according to their nuclear RNA-seq profiles and by weighted gene correlation network analysis (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04e). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells included CD14 + monocyte clusters, a transitional mo-mac state that exhibits monocytic features and macrophage markers such as MRC1 , CD68 and C1QA ; SPP1 hi mo-macs 25 characterized by SPP1 , FBP1 and IL4I1 ; and TREM2 hi mo-macs 26 characterized by GPNMB , CD9 , TREM2 and PPARG (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04f and modules in Supplementary Table\u00a04). We integrated the cellular identity from Multiome samples with 24,346 scATAC-seq-captured myeloid cells from 9 patients (Extended Data\n\nFig.\u00a04g). In close agreement with our mouse analyses, we observed motifs for TFs such as NFE2L2 , FOSL2 , JUN and BACH1 to be enriched in marker peaks of tumour-infiltrating activated CD14 + monocytes, mo-mac\\_transition and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04h).\n\nSubsequently, we prioritized TF regulators with sustained cell-typespecific activity in TME-infiltrating immunosuppressive mo-macs. Putative TF regulators in our mouse dataset included Spi1 , Mafb and Cebpb , as well as NF-\u03baB or Rel family members and AP-1 family members associated with response to inflammation and growth factors 27 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04i). Strikingly, we again observed a nexus of stress-responsive TFs, principally Nfe2l2 , Bach1 , Fosl2 , Mafk and Mafg . Concurrent analyses in our human NSCLC dataset of TME monocytes and mo-macs indicated very similar candidate regulators such as NFKB1 , REL , SPIB and CEBPB but also oxidative stress response and integrated stress response regulators NFE2L2 , BACH1 , MAFF , FOSL2 and ATF4 (Fig.\u00a02b). Downstream pathways conserved across mouse and human TME mo-macs included 'heme signalling', 'cytoprotection by HMOX1', 'response to ER stress' and 'mitochondrial biogenesis' (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j) and ranking on the basis of correlation to gene expression prioritized NFKB1 , REL , CEBPB , CEBPG and NFE2L2 (Fig.\u00a02c).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.\n\nUsing paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis of myeloid cells isolated from naive and tumour-bearing lungs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02g), we identified discrete inflammatory Ly6C hi monocytes, patrolling Ly6C low monocytes, resident tissue alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages and mo-mac subsets such as ARG1 hi mo-macs and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a). Using gene-gene correlation, we identified a module of genes implicated in anti-apoptotic cytoprotection, glycolytic metabolic shift and regulation of oxidative stress that was highly enriched in tumour-infiltrating ARG1 hi mo-macs and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b, Supplementary Table\u00a02 and Methods), regulated by TFs such as STAT3 , NFE2L2 , HIF1A , KLF4 , SPI1 and CEBPB . We captured a similar diversity of tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells in the scATAC-seq data through independent clustering of chromatin accessibility features (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c), which aligned with cell-type-specific enrichment of lineage-determining TF motifs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d). TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2 , Fosl2 and Bach1 , were specifically enriched in tumour-dominant ARG1 hi and TREM2 hi mo-macs. Phenotypically, Ly6C hi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended\n\nData Fig.\u00a03f) and intratumoural TREM2 hi mo-macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03g). In light of our findings in BM myeloid progenitors, these results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.\n\nWe simultaneously used paired single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression profiling to analyse tumour-infiltrating immune cells isolated from 14 human NSCLC lesions (Supplementary Table\u00a03). On the basis of marker gene-based filtering in our 10x Multiome dataset from 5 patients, we isolated 4,177 myeloid cells and classified them according to their nuclear RNA-seq profiles and by weighted gene correlation network analysis (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04e). Tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells included CD14 + monocyte clusters, a transitional mo-mac state that exhibits monocytic features and macrophage markers such as MRC1 , CD68 and C1QA ; SPP1 hi mo-macs 25 characterized by SPP1 , FBP1 and IL4I1 ; and TREM2 hi mo-macs 26 characterized by GPNMB , CD9 , TREM2 and PPARG (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04f and modules in Supplementary Table\u00a04). We integrated the cellular identity from Multiome samples with 24,346 scATAC-seq-captured myeloid cells from 9 patients (Extended Data\n\nFig.\u00a04g). In close agreement with our mouse analyses, we observed motifs for TFs such as NFE2L2 , FOSL2 , JUN and BACH1 to be enriched in marker peaks of tumour-infiltrating activated CD14 + monocytes, mo-mac\\_transition and TREM2 hi mo-macs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04h).\n\nSubsequently, we prioritized TF regulators with sustained cell-typespecific activity in TME-infiltrating immunosuppressive mo-macs. Putative TF regulators in our mouse dataset included Spi1 , Mafb and Cebpb , as well as NF-\u03baB or Rel family members and AP-1 family members associated with response to inflammation and growth factors 27 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04i). Strikingly, we again observed a nexus of stress-responsive TFs, principally Nfe2l2 , Bach1 , Fosl2 , Mafk and Mafg . Concurrent analyses in our human NSCLC dataset of TME monocytes and mo-macs indicated very similar candidate regulators such as NFKB1 , REL , SPIB and CEBPB but also oxidative stress response and integrated stress response regulators NFE2L2 , BACH1 , MAFF , FOSL2 and ATF4 (Fig.\u00a02b). Downstream pathways conserved across mouse and human TME mo-macs included 'heme signalling', 'cytoprotection by HMOX1', 'response to ER stress' and 'mitochondrial biogenesis' (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j) and ranking on the basis of correlation to gene expression prioritized NFKB1 , REL , CEBPB , CEBPG and NFE2L2 (Fig.\u00a02c).", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/myeloid.md"}

Brown 1,2,3,5 &amp; Miriam Merad 1,2,5,10 \u2709\n\nMonocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME) 1 and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations 2 . Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T\u00a0cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in\u00a0the\u00a0TME\n\nWe were especially interested in NRF2 because of its role in driving antioxidant gene batteries, promoting resistance to lipid-associated ferroptosis and opposing NF-\u03baB pro-inflammatory cascades 28,29 . NRF2 can also\u00a0directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation 30-33 . In the lung, we observed relative TF motif deviation for NRF2 and aggregate score for NRF2 downstream gene activation to be highest in immunoregulatory ARG1 hi and TREM2 hi mo-macs that accumulate in late-stage tumours 34 (Fig.\u00a02d). We did not rely on Nfe2l2 gene expression alone, because NRF2 is regulated post-transcriptionally and post-translationally. As a proxy for activation of NRF2 programs in\u00a0vivo, we assayed the amounts of nuclear NRF2 and intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1, encoded by Hmox1 ) 35 . TREM2 hi mo-macs had increased amounts of NRF2 and HO-1 compared with CD86 + MHCII + mo-macs in KP tumours (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03h), and mo-macs in KP GEMM also had increased amounts of NRF2 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). Similarly, in human NSCLC, NRF2 TF motif deviation was highest in immunosuppressive TREM2 hi mo-macs and recently infiltrated monocytes (mo-mac\\_transition), with concomitantly high NRF2 downstream gene activation (Fig.\u00a02e). Furthermore, we found the NRF2 activation score to be highest in tumour-associated TREM2 hi mo-macs across two independent scRNA-seq datasets 36,37 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03i and Methods).\n\nGiven the persistent NRF2 pathway activation in TME immunosuppressive mo-macs, we next explored when NRF2 was activated during GMP differentiation to monocytes and mo-macs. We observed increased NRF2 activation and HO-1 induction in mo-macs that differentiate in\u00a0vivo from adoptively transferred tumour-experienced BM GMPs, and myeloid progenitors exposed to early transient tumour conditioning (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03j,k). GMPs isolated from KP tumour-bearing mice had increased H3K4me3 promoter-proximal signal at known NRF2 oxidative stress response genes such as Gclm , Alas1 , Gsr , Prtn3 and Txnrd1 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03l), but also key immunosuppressive gene loci such as Cebpb , Ptgs1 (ref. 38), Inhba 39 , Lcn2 (ref. 40) and S100a8 (ref. 41) (Fig.\u00a02f), suggesting imprinting of immunoregulatory programs early in differentiation. Crucially, although we observed tumour-educated BM GMPs and monocytes had increased NRF2 motif accessibility compared with their tumour-free counterparts, this was not matched by activation of downstream gene programs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05b). Given the downregulation of the IFN-stimulated response in tumour-experienced BM myeloid cells, we next tested the temporal relationship of IFN responsiveness with NRF2 activation. For this, we implanted lung tumours in Mx1 GFP IFN-sensitive response element reporter mice 42 . Here tumour-associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo-macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c). Strikingly, there was a stepwise increase in Mx1 GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo-macs concomitant with NRF2 activation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c,d). Several ISGs and antigen-presentation-associated gene loci are potentially regulated by NRF2 and partner TFs at distal enhancer loci, as evident from reduced H3K27ac CUT&amp;RUN marks in KP-experienced GMPs at loci such as Mx1 , Ifitm1 , Slamf7 and H2-Ab1 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e). These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo-macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T\u00a0cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Tumour cues activate NRF2 in BM progenitors\n\nTaking a candidate approach to identify cues that activate NRF2, we found protein factors to be the dominant trigger in tumour CM (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a,b). Specifically, factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor\u00a0(GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\u00a0(G-CSF) and interleukin 6 were enriched in BM sera, blood sera and tumour CM (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06d-f). GM-CSF and interleukin 6 mimicked the impact of tumour CM on myelopoiesis, resulting in NRF2 activation, increased HO-1 expression and increased proliferation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06g,h). The myelopoietic effects of KP CM were ameliorated by incubating progenitors with anti-GM-CSF and anti-interleukin 6 neutralizing antibodies, associated with a reduction in oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06i,j). Although there was a reduction in myeloid expansion and HO-1 expression upon incubating progenitors with KP CM in the presence of ML385-an inhibitor of Nfe2l2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity 43 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06k)there was an increase in oxidative burden (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06l) suggestive of stress response uncoupling. We found that stress-responsive p38 MAPK signalling was induced in KP CM-experienced progenitors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06m) but was not affected by ML385 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06n); this suggested NRF2 pathway activation to be downstream of stress-responsive signal transduction from mitogenic cues such as GM-CSF and interleukin 6. Incubating progenitors with GM-CSF and interleukin 6 in the presence of p38 MAPK inhibitor ameliorated myelopoietic expansion as well as HO-1 expression in conjunction with reducing cellular ROS burden (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06o,p). Although we do not exclude other signals in the TME such as heme 44 , our results indicate that NRF2 activation in BM due to tumour mitogen-induced oxidative stress enables progenitors to continue expanding to meet inflammatory demand (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06q).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype.

Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME\n\nHaving established the role of NRF2 in BM myeloid expansion, we interrogated the functional consequence of NRF2 in tumour-associated myeloid cell survival and immunosuppression. Exposing BMDMs to tumour CM during the last 24 h of culture (to mimic polarization in the TME) resulted in immunosuppressive gene activation, cytoprotection and IFN response suppression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). When we cultured BMDMs from NRF2 constitutive knockout mice ( Nfe2l2 TKO ) or wild-type counterparts in the presence of KP CM, we found that tumour-conditioned Nfe2l2 TKO BMDMs had lower relative activation of Arg1 , Retnla and Chil3 , while concomitantly expressing higher amounts of the ISGs Mx1 and Nos2 (Fig.\u00a03a). Adding ML385 at day 6 resulted in a similar phenotype (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b). Remarkably, tumour-educated Nfe2l2 TKO BMDMs exhibited increased ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial stress, and increased sensitivity to cell death (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c,d). This susceptibility for cell death under redox crisis was specific to tumour condition, because Nfe2l2 TKO BMDMs did not exhibit increased cell death at steady state (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07e). Viable tumour-educated Nfe2l2 TKO BMDMs had reduced expression of HO-1, ARG1 and PD-L1 with increased expression of MHCII, CD86 and CD40 (Fig.\u00a03b), indicating a phenotypic shift towards immunogenicity and antigen presentation.\n\nNext, we generated conditional knockout mice, wherein NRF2 is floxed by Cre recombinase under the Ms4a3 promoter ( Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 ) restricted to GMPs 45 , resulting in decreased NRF2 activity. Myelopoiesis, differentiation and monocyte function in these mice were unaltered at the steady state (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f-i). We adoptively transferred GMPs from CD45.2 Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 or Nfe2l2 fl/fl control BM into congenic CD45.1 hosts bearing KP tumours, and found that GMPs from Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory CD86 + MHCII + mo-macs and strikingly fewer TREM2 hi mo-macs in the lung TME, with the TREM2 hi mo-macs having decreased PD-L1 (Fig.\u00a03c). GMPs derived from KP-experienced mice treated with quassinoid NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol 46 , when similarly transferred into congenic tumour-bearing mice, differentiated into more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig.\u00a03d). Remarkably, GMPs from tumour-naive mice administered antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) differentiated into mo-macs with increased\n\nimmunosuppressive phenotype (Fig.\u00a03d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07j). Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo-mac phenotype in the TME.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP\u00a0tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomato Ms4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2 hi mo-macs (Fig.\u00a03e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 and Nfe2l2 fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08b). We also generated transgenic mice, wherein the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) locus was floxed under Ms4a3Cre ( Keap1 \u2206Ms4a3 ) resulting in GMP-restricted loss of KEAP1, a component of the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex controlling the stability of NRF2, leading to sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1 \u2206Ms4a3 mice when compared with\n\nlittermates (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c). We next assessed myelopoiesis in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice. Although NRF2 deletion did not affect steady-state myelopoiesis (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f,g), tumour-bearing Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice had significant contraction of BM CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig.\u00a04b). Reduced NRF2 in tumoural mo-macs of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice was associated with a reduction in the number of PD-L1-expressing TREM2 hi mo-macs in the TME and a compensatory increase in CD86 + MHCII + immunogenic mo-macs (Fig.\u00a04c,d). Notably, TREM2 hi mo-macs in the TME of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice were more susceptible to cell death (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08d), providing rationale for the phenotypic shift in the TME. The mo-mac distribution in Keap1 \u2206Ms4a3 mice was tumour-promoting, with more abundant TREM2 hi mo-macs in the TME expressing PD-L1 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08e).\n\nTo measure the cell-intrinsic effect of NRF2 activation on myelopoiesis independent of tumour burden differences, we created mixed-BM chimeras with 1:1 reconstitution of CD45.2 Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 and CD45.1 Nfe2l2 WT mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08f). We observed decreased expansion of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 donor-derived GMPs in BM and lower mobilization of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes in peripheral blood (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08g). Consequently in the lung, TREM2 hi mo-macs of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 origin were also relatively less abundant, whereas CD86 + MHCII + mo-macs were increased (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08h). Integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on the myeloid progenitor lineages in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice and control counterparts (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08i) showed the most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) to be in GMPs and\n\nmonocytic lineages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08j-l). The GMP, cMoP and mature monocyte clusters in BM of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice had reduced TF motif accessibility for Nfe2l2 and Bach1 , Stat3 , Myc , Myb , Fosl2 and Atf3\n\nthat drive important facets of myeloid differentiation, proliferation and survival 47-49 (Fig.\u00a04e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08m). Type I or III IFN response regulators such as Irf3 , Irf5 and Irf9 were enriched in DARs of\n\n\n\nNfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mature Ly6C hi monocytes, matched by reduced accessibility for Hnf1a , Etv3 and Etv6 (ref. 50) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08m). Downstream of BM progenitors, molecular programs in lung-infiltrating myeloid cells were significantly altered in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08n,o). NRF2 activation scores were decreased in Ly6C hi monocytes from Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice, with a concomitant upshift in IFN-responsive gene scores (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08p). Specifically, there was relative enrichment of ISGs ( Stat1 , Rsad2 , Ifit2 , Isg20 , Ifit3b ) and antigen presentation genes ( H2-Ab1 , H2-Aa , Mef2c ) in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 TME-infiltrative monocytes and mo-macs, with a decrease in sensing pathways ( Ier3 , Tlr4 , Cd38 and C3ar1 ), immunoregulatory genes ( Chil3 , Vcan , S100a8 , Ngp , Lcn2 , Arg1 , Ptgs1 and Prtn3 ) and NRF2-associated cytoprotective genes ( Gpx3 , Gclm , Tfec and Ednrb ) (Fig.\u00a04f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08q).\n\nTo disentangle how NRF2 affects local reprogramming in the TME from how it influences replenishment through myelopoiesis, we leveraged the tamoxifen-inducible strategy to generate Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3CreERT2 mice and conditionally ablate NRF2 signalling in myeloid precursors before or after tumour exposure. Tamoxifen administration from the time of KP tumour implantation (early) in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig.\u00a04g). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3CreERT2 mice was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes (Fig.\u00a04h), reduced mobilization of CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes (Fig.\u00a04i), but insignificant changes to neutrophil mobilization and tumoural infiltration (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a,b). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling, as evidenced by reduced nuclear NRF2 in TME mo-macs, was associated with accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig.\u00a04j,k). Reduced myeloid NRF2 signalling was associated with significant infiltration of tumoricidal IFN\u03b3 + natural killer cells into lung tumours (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09c-e). Effector CD8 + T\u00a0cells were also more abundant in the tumours of Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09f,g). Depletion of monocytes and mo-macs in KP\u00a0tumour-bearing NRF2-proficient mice resulted in a clear reduction in tumour burden, signifying the importance of mo-macs in KP progression, but such treatment in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice saw no additive impact, suggesting NRF2 activation in mo-macs is crucial to orchestrating immunosuppression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09h). Furthermore, depletion of natural killer cells in tumour-bearing Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice resulted in greater tumour burden, highlighting the mode of immunoregulation in this model to be predominantly by means of natural killer cell exclusion and suppression 34 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09i).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

To do so, we first administered NRF2 inhibitor ML385 in KP\u00a0tumour-bearing LSL-TdTomato Ms4a3CreERT2 reporter mice and pulsed with one dose of tamoxifen to trace the fate of recently emigrated GMP-derived cells in the TME. NRF2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of TdTomato-labelled intratumoural mo-macs and neutrophils 8 days post-tamoxifen, with a significant reduction in the frequency of TREM2 hi mo-macs (Fig.\u00a03e). Consequently, we implanted KP tumours orthotopically in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 and Nfe2l2 fl/fl mice. Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice had a significant reduction in KP burden and greater overall survival (Fig.\u00a04a and Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a). Similar results were obtained in the LLC1 lung cancer model and the B16-F10 model of melanoma lung metastases (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08b). We also generated transgenic mice, wherein the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) locus was floxed under Ms4a3Cre ( Keap1 \u2206Ms4a3 ) resulting in GMP-restricted loss of KEAP1, a component of the Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex controlling the stability of NRF2, leading to sustained NRF2 activity and an increase in NRF2 downstream programs. KP tumours were significantly larger in Keap1 \u2206Ms4a3 mice when compared with\n\nlittermates (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c). We next assessed myelopoiesis in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3 mice.

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T\u00a0cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.\n\nA main focus in cancer immunotherapy has been reprogramming monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) in the microenvironment of solid tumours to reverse immunosuppression and unleash T\u00a0cell and/ or natural killer cell responses 3 . Although this TME-centric approach has considerable merit, it fails to tackle the 'wellspring' of bone marrow (BM) myeloid progenitors seeding monocytes and mo-macs in the TME through tumour-driven myelopoiesis 2,4 . Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers 5-8 , but molecular mechanisms remain elusive. As our view of systemic tumour-host crosstalk expands, it becomes important to understand whether tumoural cues alter the molecular state of myeloid progenitors in BM, priming genes that ultimately affect anti-tumour responses. Understanding the mechanics of mo-mac replenishment and plasticity of mo-mac development during cancer inflammation is key to breaking the vicious cycle of tumour myelopoiesis, and developing more efficacious myeloid-targeting therapies.\n\nHere we sought to identify epigenetic changes that prime myeloid progenitors in lung tumour-bearing hosts, probe their contribution towards pro-tumorigenic mo-macs in the TME, and harness this knowledge to redirect TME mo-mac fate towards an anti-tumour phenotype.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy\n\nGiven the impact of NRF2 activation on mo-macs curtailing anti-tumour natural killer cell and T\u00a0cell surveillance, we interrogated whether myeloid NRF2 influences immunotherapy response. In three independent scRNA-seq datasets of immunotherapy or chemotherapy response comparing baseline with post-therapy tissue, tumour-infiltrating mo-macs enriched in non-responders (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010a-c and Methods), as well as circulating CD14 + monocytes in non-responders with stable disease (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010d) had DEGs regulated by TFs such as PPARG , TP63 , SMAD4 and NFE2L2 . Spurred on by our observations, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of NRF2 can enhance response to checkpoint blockade. We administered NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol with or without anti-PD-1 therapy starting at day 9 post-KP tumour implant. Combination treatment significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig.\u00a04l), affected myelopoiesis as evidenced by the reduction of CMPs, GMPs and cMoPs (Fig.\u00a04m), and reduced mobilization of CD157 + Ly6C hi monocytes (Fig.\u00a04n). These systemic changes were associated with a decrease in the abundance of mo-macs, specific decrease in PD-L1 + TREM2 hi mo-macs and concomitant increase in CD86 + MHCII + mo-macs (Fig.\u00a04o). Combination of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 prolonged survival outcomes beyond benefit derived from anti-PD-1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010e). A similar dosing regimen using ML385 in conjunction with anti-PD-1 had similarly improved outcomes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010f). We found the efficacy of combination therapy relied on targeting of myeloid NRF2, because administration of Brusatol and anti-PD-1 in Nfe2l2 \u2206Ms4a3Cre mice had no additive impact on anti-tumour immunity (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010g). Anti-tumour immunity was associated with a substantial influx of natural killer cells with increased expression of CD69 and tumoricidal IFN\u03b3 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010h), alongside effector CD8 + T\u00a0cells lacking exhaustion marks, and producing IFN\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010i).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Tumour gene expression altered by TME\n\nTo study the influence of the local microenvironment on tumour invasion, we applied spatially resolved transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to a transgenic zebrafish model of BRAF V600E -driven melanoma (Fig. 1a). Tumours from this model frequently invade into adjacent tissues, including the underlying dermis and muscle. Across fish, we found a conserved 'interface' transcriptional cell state that occurs where tumour cells invade into the microenvironment 6 (12.1% of zebrafish tumour cells; Fig. 1a).\n\nTo investigate whether these interface cells occur in patients, we analysed a recently published human melanoma scRNA-seq dataset of 7,186 tumour and stromal cells from 31 patients with untreated or immunotherapy-resistant melanoma 7 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets. Similar to\n\nour previous observations 6 , a subpopulation of human tumour cells highly upregulated interface markers (12.3% of tumour cells; Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b), mostly from immunotherapy-resistant patients (Extended Data Fig. 1d-f). To better understand the nature of these cells, we compared our interface population to human melanoma cell states. A previous study defined at least four cell states that encompass the melanoma differentiation trajectory (melanocytic, transitory, neural crest-like and undifferentiated) 2 . We scored tumour and interface cells for the relative expression of gene modules encompassing the entire melanoma cell differentiation trajectory and classified cells into each of the four states on the basis of their expression of gene modules annotated for that state 2 . Although tumour cells were relatively evenly distributed between the four cell states, interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c).\n\nMelanoma behaviour is regulated by phenotype switching, in which cells transition between differentiated/proliferative and undifferentiated/invasive states. The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF , SOX9 and SOX10 , among others 8 . MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation 9,10 , whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state 11 . Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g). Classical melanocyte pigmentation genes were minimally expressed by interface cells relative to the tumour bulk, including MITF (log 2 fold change (FC) = -5.19), TYRP1 (log 2 FC = -7.75) and PMEL (log 2 FC = -8.78) (Fig. 1f, Extended Data\u00a0Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log 2 FC = 5.15), NNAT (log 2 FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log 2 FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log 2 FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that transcriptional programs linked to cell fate specification and neuronal development were highly enriched in interface cells (Fig. 1h,i). These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Confinement induces a neuronal state\n\nTo examine factors within the local TME that may drive the interface state, we performed histology on tissue sections from our transgenic zebrafish melanoma model, focusing on the invasive front. Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j,k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments 12 . Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in\u00a0vitro at predefined heights (3 \u03bcm) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips 13 (Fig. 1l). Confinement in\u00a0vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2). We calculated the overlap between the human interface gene signature and the confined melanoma gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Table 3). Pathway analysis showed that many of the co-regulated genes were related to neuronal development\n\n(Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j,k). A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments 12 . Although numerous factors probably influence tumour invasion, we hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we adapted a system to confine human melanoma cells (A375 cell line) in\u00a0vitro at predefined heights (3 \u03bcm) using a polydimethylsiloxane piston and micropatterned coverslips 13 (Fig. 1l). Confinement in\u00a0vitro was not cytotoxic because confined cells did not upregulate apoptosis markers cleaved caspase-3, annexin V or cleaved PARP (Extended Data Fig. 2a-f). Post-confinement, cells recovered typical morphology within 24 h without widespread cell death (Extended Data Fig. 2g). To profile confinement-induced changes in gene expression, we confined A375 cells for approximately 18 h and performed bulk RNA-seq. Principal component analysis revealed considerable transcriptional alterations induced by confinement (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Table 2). Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton\n\nNeuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function 14 . The cytoskeleton often transmits force within and between cells and remodels in response to mechanical stimuli 15 . Recent reports indicate that the MT cytoskeleton is stabilized by force to protect confined cells from damage 16 . We hypothesized that melanoma cells hijack neuronal mechanisms to allow them to invade into the mechanically confined microenvironment. We used our in\u00a0vitro confinement system to characterize how force remodels the MT cytoskeleton by imaging A375 cells labelled with the MT vital dye SiR-tubulin. Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b). This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force 16 . We also observed loss of a central MT organizing centre with radial MTs, reminiscent of neurons with centrosome-independent MT organization 14,17 . These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.\n\nAcetylated tubulin mediates neuronal architecture and function and marks axonal MTs 18 . Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure 19 . Curved MTs, such as those we observed in confined cells (Fig. 2a,b), are also indicative of long-lived, stabilized MTs 19 . We performed immunofluorescence on sections from adult fish with transgenic BRAF V600E -driven melanomas and observed enrichment of acetylated tubulin at the tumour border 6 (Fig. 2c-e). Confining A375 cells in\u00a0vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin ( P = 6.86 \u00d7 10 -12 ; Fig. 2f-h). Acetylated tubulin filaments in unconfined cells were typically short and linear, whereas in confined cells, acetylated tubulin filaments were longer and more curved-again indicative of stabilization (Fig. 2f,g).\n\nWe noticed that in confined cells, the hyperacetylated tubulin network was often perinuclear (Fig. 2f,g) and hypothesized that this network may provide structural support to the nucleus. As the stiffest and largest organelle, the nucleus is vulnerable to confinement-induced stress, with confined migration often causing nuclear envelope rupture and DNA damage 20,21 . During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus 22,23 . We confirmed the stability of the perinuclear MT network by treating confined cells with nocodazole, which induces MT disassembly through an acetylation-independent mechanism 24 . Acetylated MTs are resistant to nocodazole 19 . Nocodazole (1 \u03bcM) induced the disassembly of almost all non-modified tubulin filaments in both unconfined and confined cells (Fig. 2i,j). Although unconfined nocodazole-treated cells exhibited minimal acetylated tubulin, many confined nocodazole-treated cells contained a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage (Fig. 2i,j). We generated a stable A375 cell line, in which the main eukaryotic tubulin acetyltransferase (ATAT1) was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), and found that this almost completely abolished acetylated tubulin, including the perinuclear network (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e). This indicates that ATAT1 is the acetyltransferase that responds to mechanical stress in melanoma cells by stabilizing the tubulin cytoskeleton.\n\nIn addition to acetylation, MTs exhibit a variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation and methylation, which influence MT stability 25 . To clarify the composition of the perinuclear tubulin network, we used immunofluorescence to characterize MT PTMs in confined melanoma cells. Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs 26 . However, most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase\n\nin melanoma 27 . Although confined perinuclear MTs were occasionally tyrosinated and rarely detyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), there was no specific enrichment of these PTMs in the perinuclear network, as observed for acetylated MTs. Similar results were observed for polyglutamylated MTs (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). No polyglycylated MTs were found in either condition (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network. These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2\n\nOur results indicate that confinement induces a neuronal identity in interface melanoma cells, characterized by changes in cytoskeletal architecture and gene expression. We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinementinduced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain 28 . Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma 29 , their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b ) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells 6 . HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells ( P = 3.24 \u00d7 10 -37 ; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h).\n\nTo validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity ( R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10 -12 ; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in\u00a0vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells ( P = 1.42 \u00d7 10 -7 ; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P = 0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase ( P = 3.01 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2-GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2-GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.\n\nWe examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2 + and AcTub + ), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub + and HMGB2 - ), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2 + nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub -and HMGB2 + ) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates our scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c).\n\nWe then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types. We focused on two cancer types probably influenced by mechanical stress in\u00a0vivo: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer.

We examined our zebrafish and human transcriptomic datasets to identify potential confinementinduced mediators of this state. Interface cells consistently upregulated high mobility group (HMG)-family proteins (Fig. 3a), which regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain 28 . Although HMG-enriched transcriptional programs are upregulated across many tumour types, including melanoma 29 , their contribution to tumour progression remains poorly understood. We focused on HMGB2 (zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b ) because it was the most upregulated HMG family member in interface cells from zebrafish (Fig. 3a,b), and because our previous study identified HMGB2 as a signalling factor enriched in interface cells 6 . HMGB2 was also highly upregulated by human interface cells ( P = 3.24 \u00d7 10 -37 ; Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 1h).\n\nTo validate our transcriptomic results indicating that HMGB2 is upregulated at the invasive front, we examined HMGB2 expression in zebrafish melanoma tissue sections. In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g), indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation. HMGB2 concentrations were inversely correlated to nuclear circularity ( R = -0.474; P = 1.19 \u00d7 10 -12 ; Fig. 3g). Similarly, the in\u00a0vitro confinement of A375 human melanoma cells caused nuclear HMGB2 intensity to approximately double relative to unconfined cells ( P = 1.42 \u00d7 10 -7 ; Fig. 3h,i). This increase was not solely attributable to changes in nuclear density; although Hoechst intensity also slightly increased upon confinement (probably owing to compaction of chromatin/the nucleus; P = 0.0017; Fig. 3j), normalizing HMGB2 to Hoechst concentrations still showed a significant increase ( P = 3.01 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Fig. 3k). Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of A375 cells stably expressing HMGB2-GFP, we found nuclear HMGB2-GFP concentrations increased linearly over approximately 16 h (0.269 \u00b1 0.020-fold per hour) to a final concentration of 1.76 \u00b1 0.072-fold relative to initial concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f), indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.\n\nWe examined a human melanoma tissue microarray to look for evidence of interface cells with elongated nuclei, high HMGB2 concentrations and perinuclear acetylated tubulin. As in the zebrafish, the invasive front in human samples often contained elongated nuclei with high HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin expression, although with expected interpatient variability (Extended Data Fig. 6a-e). Of the 40 patient samples analysed, 20 (50%) contained putative interface cells (elongated nuclei, HMGB2 + and AcTub + ), nine (22.5%) contained cells exhibiting perinuclear acetylated tubulin enrichment only (AcTub + and HMGB2 - ), three (7.5%) contained cells with elongated HMGB2 + nuclei but no acetylated tubulin (AcTub -and HMGB2 + ) and the remaining eight (20%) showed no enrichment of HMGB2 or acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). This validates our scRNA-seq analyses, indicating that interface cells are present in human samples (Fig. 1c).\n\nWe then investigated whether the upregulation of HMGB2 and acetylated tubulin by confined cells is melanoma-specific or exhibited across other cancer types.

White 1,10 \u2709\n\nP  he  notype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states 1,2 . Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin\u00a02\n\nTo investigate how mechanical confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation, we focused on the MT cytoskeleton, hypothesizing that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network (Fig. 2f,g) may propagate confinement-induced force to the nucleus. To confirm that the perinuclear network is upstream of HMGB2 enrichment in the confinement response, we generated stable A375 cell lines in which HMGB2 was inactivated using CRISPR (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c). Upon confining two different A375-HMGB2 KO cell lines, we confirmed that the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network was unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e).\n\nWe modulated tubulin dynamics and acetylation state in confined cells to determine whether the acetylated tubulin network influences HMGB2 upregulation. Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (ref. 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (ref. 32). We first treated A375 cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin 33 , which increased tubulin acetylation without affecting histone acetylation (Extended Data Fig. 9a-f). In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation ( P = 1.1646 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 \u00b1 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 \u00d7 10 -6 ; Extended Data Fig. 9i). To stabilize MTs independent of acetylation, we treated confined cells with paclitaxel (Taxol), which binds \u03b2-tubulin and prevents tubulin monomer incorporation into MT filaments and thus should not influence the acetylation state of HMGB2 or other proteins 34 . Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells ( P = 0.00230; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h), with an accumulation rate remarkably similar to tubacin-treated cells (0.338 \u00b1 0.0425-fold per hour versus 0.353 \u00b1 0.0364-fold per hour; P = 0.961; Extended Data Fig. 9i). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects of tubacin on HMGB2, similar results in Taxol-treated and tubacin-treated cells indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions.\n\nTo confirm the role of perinuclear acetylated tubulin in mediating HMGB2 accumulation, we treated A375[HMGB2-GFP] cells with nocodazole before applying confinement. Nocodazole abolishes most MT networks, with the exception of stabilized acetylated tubulin filaments 24 . Because the perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage was resistant to nocodazole (Fig. 2i,j), nocodazole treatment allowed us to specifically interrogate the contribution of acetylated MTs to HMGB2 upregulation in confined cells. We observed near total loss of visible SiR-tubulin signal in confined nocodazole-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 9j), whereas the perinuclear acetylated tubulin network remained intact (Fig. 2i,j) and HMGB2-GFP accumulation was unaffected ( P = 0.714; Extended Data Fig. 9k,l). We quantified HMGB2 accumulation in confined A375ATAT1 KO cells lacking acetylated tubulin (Extended Data Fig. 3c-e).\n\n\n\nUnexpectedly, HMGB2 accumulation was not impaired in ATAT1 KO cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f), suggesting that acetylated tubulin is sufficient but not necessary for the enrichment of HMGB2 in response to confinement.\n\nThus, we investigated other factors that may cooperate with the MT cytoskeleton to promote upregulation of HMGB2 in confined cells using TurboID 35 to perform proximity labelling proteomics targeting HMGB2 interactors (Fig. 3l and Supplementary Table 4). One highly enriched protein was nesprin\u00a02 (gene name: SYNE2 ), a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin 36 (Fig. 3m and Supplementary Table 4). We hypothesized that nesprin\u00a02 may be required for enrichment of HMGB2 upon confinement. Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin\u00a02 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin\u00a02 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\n\nThe LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness 36 . Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells ( P = 1.28 \u00d7 10 -162 ; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Accordingly, confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin\u00a02 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q). This indicates that nesprin\u00a02 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.\n\nThe LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness 36 . Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells ( P = 1.28 \u00d7 10 -162 ; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g). Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/mechanical.md"}

White 1,10 \u2709\n\nP  he  notype switching is a form of cellular plasticity in which cancer cells reversibly move between two opposite extremes: proliferative versus invasive states 1,2 . Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics\n\nOur results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2. HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain 37 . Confinement-induced nuclear shape changes could\u00a0thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize nuclear HMGB2 dynamics upon confinement. As previously reported 38 , HMGB2-GFP was highly dynamic even in unconfined cells (Fig. 4a-d), with only approximately 25% stably bound within the nucleus (mobile fraction = 75.21 \u00b1 0.91%). In both conditions, FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two-component exponential equation (average\u00a0coefficient of determination ( R 2 )\u00a0= 0.986 \u00b1 0.00054; Fig. 4d,e and\u00a0Methods), indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast-diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower-diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) 39 . Although more than 90% of HMGB2 remained fast-diffusing in both conditions, confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 \u00b1 0.39% versus 4.21 \u00b1 0.39%; P = 1.134 \u00d7 10 -5 ; Fig. 4f), suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2chromatin interactions in confined cells.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g). Peak-gene mapping and pathway analysis revealed that open chromatin regions were highly enriched for neuronal genes, with increased accessibility at loci linked to the neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h-j and Supplementary Table 5). Homer de\u00a0novo motif analysis identified conserved transcription factor binding motifs enriched within the promoter of open chromatin regions upon HMGB2 overexpression (HMGB2 OE ). The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10 -49 ), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity 40,41 . Other highly ranked motifs included PRDM4 , which functions in neural development 42 (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10 -12 ), and SOX9 , a critical regulator of the pro-invasive phenotype switch in melanoma 43 (Fig. 4k; P = 1 \u00d7 10 -11 ). These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program.\n\nTo clarify potential HMGB2 targets, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq) targeting HMGB2 in A375 cells using a double-crosslinking approach 44 (Extended Data Fig. 11a). We generated a peak atlas by comparing peaks present in cells expressing baseline concentrations of HMGB2 to those not present in HMGB2 KO  cells, yielding 843 peaks, consistent with previous studies 44-46 (Supplementary Table 6). After manual filtering to remove intergenic, low-quality or non-specific peaks, we identified a final high-confidence set of 96 targets (Extended Data Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 6). We observed HMGB2 binding at promoter regions of several AP-1 signalling genes, including FOSL1 , JUNB and JUND (Extended Data Fig. 11c and Supplementary Table 6), validating our ATAC-seq results and supporting the pro-invasive role of HMGB2. Several neuronal genes were also identified as HMGB2 targets, including NOTCH2 , NOTCH2NLC , TBX6 , GBA1 and ZNF335 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6), as well as pro-tumorigenic genes such as KMT2A (Extended Data Fig. 11e and Supplementary Table 6).\n\nTo examine the transcriptional effects, we performed bulk RNA-seq on A375 cells stably overexpressing HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 11f). HMGB2 OE  cells adopted a mesenchymal-like and invasive morphology relative to empty vector controls (Extended Data Fig. 11g). The most highly upregulated gene was UNC5D , a netrin receptor promoting neuronal survival and migration 47 (Extended Data Fig. 11h and Supplementary Table 7). Other upregulated neuronal genes included DCC , SH3GL2 and NPX2 (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i and Supplementary Table 7). GSEA revealed an overrepresentation of neuronal genes within enriched pathways (Extended Data Fig. 11j,k and Supplementary Table 7). Supporting a pro-invasive role for HMGB2, several invasive genes were also upregulated ( MAGEA1 , SPP1 , CTAG2 and GDF6 ; Extended Data Fig. 11i and Supplementary Table 7). These data indicate that HMGB2 alters chromatin architecture to promote an invasive neuronal state.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in melanoma is controlled by a regulatory axis of melanocytic transcription factors ( MITF ) driving proliferation versus invasive factors ( BRN2 , SOX9 and AP-1 ) that also slow proliferation. We investigated whether HMGB2 drives invasion through these factors. Using the SKMEL5 melanocytic cell line, we created a stable line expressing V5-tagged HMGB2 and performed ChIP-seq targeting V5 and HMGB2 (Extended Data Fig. 12a). We generated a peak atlas containing 1,361 peaks corresponding to 1,286 unique genes (Extended Data Fig. 12b and Supplementary Table 8). We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the MITF promoter (Extended Data Fig. 12c). However, loss of HMGB2 did not meaningfully alter MITF expression (log 2 FC = 0.157; Extended Data Fig. 12e-g and Supplementary Table 9), indicating that HMGB2 may regulate pro-invasive factors instead. HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells. Notch family genes were also upregulated by human interface cells ( DLL1 , DLL3 and DLK2 ; Supplementary Table 1) and confined human melanoma cells ( NOTCH2NLA , DLK2 and DLL4 ; Supplementary Table 2). Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 ( BRN2 , also known as POU3F2 ) (ref. 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma 49 that also functions in neuronal development 50 . This indicates\n\nthat invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling. Supporting this model, a BRN2 / POU3F2 motif was enriched in the promoter region of HMGB2 target genes (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Although MITF and BRN2 expressions are often inversely correlated 51 , previous reports 52,53 and our data indicate that these factors can also be co-expressed. Characterizing the mechanisms that control the expression of these factors and the regulation of the proliferative/invasive trade-off will be an important area for future investigation.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Our data indicate that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 could mediate this phenotypic plasticity. Confined A375 cells downregulated many proliferation-related pathways (Fig. 5b). To visualize the influence of confinement on this trade-off, we generated an A375 cell line stably expressing the FastFUCCI cell cycle sensor 54 . Upon confinement, all initially mitotic cells (mAG + and S/G2-M phase) rapidly lost mAG fluorescence, indicating cell cycle exit (Fig. 5c,d).\n\nTo directly test the role of HMGB2 in melanoma invasion, we used in\u00a0vitro invasion assays (Fig. 5e) and found that targeting HMGB2 with siRNA significantly impaired invasion ( P = 0.0133; Fig. 5f,g), whereas overexpression of HMGB2 increased invasion ( P = 0.0180; Fig. 5h,i). Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion 13,55-57 . We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 \u00b1 0.0025 \u03bcm min -1 ; Extended Data Fig. 13a-c), which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system. To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in\u00a0vivo, we generated BRAF V600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR. Loss of hmgb2 and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks ( P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j-l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m). These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state.\n\nHMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail region 58 (Extended Data Fig. 14a). We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma. We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c). We were unable to express a truncated construct lacking both DNA-binding domains, probably because of its small size (24 amino acids). In in\u00a0vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either \u2206A-box or \u2206B-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2; this was probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f). Because we were unable to generate constructs lacking both DNA-binding domains, when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j), demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.\n\nThe ability of cancer cells to adopt new phenotypes without further DNA mutations is now well understood to substantially influence tumour behaviour. Such plasticity has long been observed in melanoma, where early studies identified transcriptomic and phenotypic states not linked to specific genetic lesions 1 . More recent evidence indicates that most tumours encompass a heterogeneous yet reproducible number of transcriptional states 3,4 . The extent to which tumour cells transition between states is an open area of investigation and has been hypothesized to be regulated by cues from the tumour microenvironment (TME). The identification of such cues has clinical relevance because they may enable the conversion of a superficial melanoma into an invasive and drug-resistant one 5 . Here using a combination of zebrafish transgenics and human samples, we show that mechanical confinement by the adjacent microenvironment induces stable changes in chromatin architecture that cause melanoma cells to transition from a proliferative to an invasive state.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance\n\nPhenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance 2 . This has important clinical relevance because drug-tolerant persister cells are major contributors to relapse 59 . We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response, hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance. To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs. Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest 60 , indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation 8 .\n\nWe then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in\u00a0vivo by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib, widely used targeted therapies in melanoma 61 (Fig. 5n). HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in\u00a0vivo ( P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10). Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15).\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Fig. 3 | Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the aged hippocampus increases synaptic protein expression and rescues age-related cognitive impairments.\n\na , Representative images and quantification of total neurite length and Sholl analysis of primary mouse neurons after viral-mediated knockdown of Ftl1 (Ftl1 KD) or luciferase (control). Neurons were infected at DIV8 and analyzed at DIV18. Five images per coverslip were taken, and 5-9 neurons were analyzed per coverslip, with the average per coverslip serving as a replicate ( N = 5 control and N = 5 Ftl1 KD replicates per group) (total length P = 0.0182; total intersections P = 0.0004; intersections versus distance P &lt; 0.0001). b , Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of aged (18 months) mice after viralmediated knockdown of Ftl1 (Ftl1 KD) or control and representative western blot and quantification of hippocampal FTL1 protein ( P = 0.0323). c , Representative images and quantification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus of mice after viral-mediated Ftl1 knockdown (Ftl1 KD) or control ( N = 5 control and N = 4 Ftl1 KD mice per group (SYN P = 0.0132, PSD95 P = 0.1324; excitatory P = 0.0777)). d , Representative images and quantification of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice after viral-mediated Ftl1 knockdown (Ftl1 KD) or control ( N = 5 control and N = 4 Ftl1 KD mice per group (SYN P = 0.0257, GEPH P = 0.0031; inhibitory P = 0.2984)). e , Schematic of the timeline of hippocampal stereotaxic injections and cognitive behavioral testing for aged mice after Ftl1 abrogation (Ftl1 KD). f , Object recognition memory assesed by NOR as the discrimination index for the novel object relative to the familiar object ( N = 16 control ( P = 0.4977) and N = 17 Ftl1 KD ( P = 0.0010) aged mice per group). g , Spatial working memory assessed by Y maze as the discrimination index demonstrating no preference (Fig. 2h,i). As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d-f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.\n\nTo begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1 , we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).\n\nNext, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d-f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.\n\nTo determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, for the novel arm relative to the trained arm ( N = 17 control ( P = 0.1895) and N = 18 Ftl1 KD ( P = 0.0072) aged mice per group). h , Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of aged Rosa26-loxPSTOP -loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice after neuronal-specific viral-mediated expression of guide RNAs targeting Ftl1 (Ftl1 cKO) or control and representative western blot and quantification of hippocampal FTL1 protein ( N = 5 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group ( P = 0.0076)). i , Representative images and quantification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice ( N = 6 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.0028, PSD95 P = 0.0140; excitatory P = 0.0773)). j , Representative images and quantification of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice ( N = 5 control and N = 9 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.1091, GEPH P = 0.1091, inhibitory P = 0.0472)). k , Schematic of the timeline of hippocampal stereotaxic injections and cognitive behavioral testing for aged Rosa26-loxPSTOP -loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice with loss of neuronal Ftl1 . i , Object recognition memory assesed by NOR as the discrimination index for the novel object relative to the familiar object ( N = 17 aged control ( P = 0.1423) and N = 9 aged Ftl1 cKO ( P = 0.0087) mice per group). j , Spatial working memory assessed by Y maze as the discrimination index for the novel arm relative to the trained arm ( N = 21 aged control ( P = 0.5796) and N = 14 aged Ftl1 cKO ( P = 0.2676) mice per group).

Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c). Hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged FTL1 cKO mice (Fig. 3k). Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1,\n\nselectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d-f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.\n\nTo identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a-d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/ CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j-l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j-l).\n\nmediated in part through alterations in metabolic processes. a , Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of young mice after neuronal-specific viral-mediated overexpression of Ftl1 (Ftl1 OE) or GFP control. b , Volcano plot illustrating differential gene expression in hippocampal neurons of Ftl1 OE compared to control mice.

Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb , Atp5o , Atp5c1 , Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).\n\nConsequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation) 21-23 after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 +  neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a-d).

Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.\n\nFTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes 24 -a key hallmark of the aging process 25,26 . Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD + and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents 27-29 , similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.\n\nExcess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis 30,31 , an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease 32,33 . Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe 2+ -specific and Fe 3+ -specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe 2+ or Fe 3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio 20 . The observed decrease in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.\n\nAlterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur 34,35 . Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.\n\nFrom a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders 2,36,37 such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy-a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments 38-40 . Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease 41 . Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

As a control, we profiled general health using an open-field paradigm and observed no differences in overall activity, total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Extended Data Fig. 3d-f). Our functional data indicate that mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 negatively regulates synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent memory.\n\nTo begin to investigate the converse effect of abrogating neuronal Ftl1 , we used a complementary viral-mediated RNA interference in vitro approach. Primary neurons were infected with lentivirus encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting Ftl1 (sh-Ftl1) or luciferase control (sh-Luc) (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). Decreased neuronal FTL1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 4c) resulted in an increase in total neurite length as well as in dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons by immunocytochemical analysis (Fig. 3a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under RNA interference conditions (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e).\n\nNext, we sought to explore the potential benefit of targeting the age-related increase of FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice. We performed targeted stereotaxic injections of a high-titer virus encoding shRNA sequences targeting either Ftl1 or luciferase control into the CA1 and dentate gyrus hippocampal regions of aged mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Abrogation of FTL1 was validated by western blot (Fig. 3b). We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis, and, in contrast to the effects observed with FTL1 overexpression, targeting Ftl1 led to an increase in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the aged hippocampus (Fig. 3c,d). Additionally, we observed an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Functionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was assessed using NOR and forced alternation Y maze in aged mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 knockdown (Fig. 3e). Consistent with age-related cognitive decline, control aged mice showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 3f,g). Notably, abrogating FTL1 in the aged hippocampus resulted in cognitive improvements (Fig. 3f,g). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d-f). These data suggest that targeting hippocampal FTL1 restores known age-related synaptic molecular changes and cognitive function in aged mice.\n\nTo determine the effect of selectively targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we generated aged, temporally controlled, for the novel arm relative to the trained arm ( N = 17 control ( P = 0.1895) and N = 18 Ftl1 KD ( P = 0.0072) aged mice per group). h , Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of aged Rosa26-loxPSTOP -loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice after neuronal-specific viral-mediated expression of guide RNAs targeting Ftl1 (Ftl1 cKO) or control and representative western blot and quantification of hippocampal FTL1 protein ( N = 5 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group ( P = 0.0076)). i , Representative images and quantification of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice ( N = 6 control and N = 6 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.0028, PSD95 P = 0.0140; excitatory P = 0.0773)). j , Representative images and quantification of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of Ftl1 cKO or control mice ( N = 5 control and N = 9 Ftl1 cKO mice per group (SYN P = 0.1091, GEPH P = 0.1091, inhibitory P = 0.0472)). k , Schematic of the timeline of hippocampal stereotaxic injections and cognitive behavioral testing for aged Rosa26-loxPSTOP -loxP-Cas9-eGFP transgenic mice with loss of neuronal Ftl1 . i , Object recognition memory assesed by NOR as the discrimination index for the novel object relative to the familiar object ( N = 17 aged control ( P = 0.1423) and N = 9 aged Ftl1 cKO ( P = 0.0087) mice per group). j , Spatial working memory assessed by Y maze as the discrimination index for the novel arm relative to the trained arm ( N = 21 aged control ( P = 0.5796) and N = 14 aged Ftl1 cKO ( P = 0.2676) mice per group).

Decreased FTL1 levels were validated by western blot (Fig. 3h). We observed an increase in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and an increase in NR2A, AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot in the hippocampus of aged FTL1 cKO mice compared to controls (Fig. 3i,j and Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Consistent with abrogation of hippocampal FTL1,\n\nselectively targeting neuronal Ftl1 resulted in cognitive improvements in memory in FTL1 cKO mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3l,m). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 6d-f). These behavioral data indicate that targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age mitigates age-related cognitive impairments.\n\nTo identify potential mechanisms underlying the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function, we characterized the transcriptomes of hippocampal neurons from young and aged mice after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression and abrogation, respectively, by neuronal nuclei RNA-seq approaches (Fig. 4a,d). We detected 100 differentially expressed genes in young mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 and 309 differentially expressed genes in aged mice after hippocampal FTL1 knockdown compared to control conditions (Fig. 4b,e and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We performed Gene Ontology analysis and identified changes in energy metabolism pathways and synaptic processes (Fig. 4c,f). To gain further regional and cell-type-specific resolution, we assessed molecular changes elicited by viral-mediated Ftl1 knockout by single-nuclei RNA-seq (Fig. 4g). Cell clusters were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach and projected by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) onto a two-dimensional plot (Fig. 4h). Signatures of each cluster were generated by differential gene expression analysis to compare clusters. Cell types were established based on transcriptomic signatures, and populations were compared across genotypes (Extended Data Fig. 7). We performed bioinformatics analysis on excitatory hippocampal neurons, and Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between FTL1 cKO and control mice identified predominantly metabolic processes (Fig. 4i). Concordantly, we observed increased expression of genes related to aerobic respiration and proton-driven ATP synthesis in excitatory neurons of FTL1 cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a-d). Next, we analyzed clusters of CA1 pyramidal neurons, CA2/ CA3 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cell neurons separately (Fig. 4j-l). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production, oxidative phosphorylation and NADH across hippocampal neuronal cell types (Fig. 4j-l).\n\nmediated in part through alterations in metabolic processes. a , Schematic of hippocampal stereotaxic injections of young mice after neuronal-specific viral-mediated overexpression of Ftl1 (Ftl1 OE) or GFP control. b , Volcano plot illustrating differential gene expression in hippocampal neurons of Ftl1 OE compared to control mice.

Of the genes that are downregulated in the young hippocampus after increased neuronal FTL1 and upregulated in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1, we detected 32 genes that were bidirectionally changed (Fig. 4m and Supplementary Table 6). Gene Ontology analysis of this gene set identified metabolic processes associated with ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 4n), with restored neuronal expression of genes including Sdhb , Atp5o , Atp5c1 , Ndufa10 and Atp5j in the aged hippocampus after abrogation of neuronal FTL1 (Fig. 4o). To corroborate our RNA-seq findings using an orthogonal approach, we measured neuronal ATP production rate by Seahorse assay after viral-mediated overexpression and abrogation of FTL1 in primary neurons. Increasing neuronal FTL1 significantly compromised ATP production (Fig. 4p), whereas abrogation of FTL1 resulted in increased ATP production compared to control conditions (Fig. 4q).\n\nConsequently, we reasoned that boosting metabolic function might counter the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1. To begin to test this possibility, primary neurons were treated with NADH (a coenzyme driving ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation) 21-23 after viral-mediated FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 4r and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with our previous observation, we detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 +  neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 4r); however, this decrease was mitigated after NADH treatment (Fig. 4r). No changes in neuronal toxicity were observed (Extended Data Fig. 9b). To investigate the effect of NADH supplementation on cognitive function, young adult mice were administered NADH after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression, and hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed by NOR and Y maze (Fig. 4s). Although young mice with increased neuronal FTL1 expression showed no preference for either a novel object or a novel arm, these cognitive deficits were mitigated after NADH supplementation (Fig. 4t,u). No differences in overall activity were detected between experimental groups (Extended Data Fig. 10a-d).

Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice promotes synaptic changes and cognitive impairments indicative of hippocampal aging. Conversely, targeting the age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 reverses synaptic changes and restores hippocampal-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Mechanistically, we implicate changes in metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 and demonstrate that boosting metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigates these pro-aging effects on cognition. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the molecular underpinnings of cognitive aging and identify neuronal FTL1 as a potential therapeutic target to counter age-related cognitive dysfunction.\n\nFTL1 comprises the light chain of ferritin and is involved in the long-term storage of iron. Disruption in iron metabolism is known to promote mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent alterations in metabolic processes 24 -a key hallmark of the aging process 25,26 . Age-related increased levels of neuronal FTL1 detected in the hippocampus are likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging. This is congruent with our neuronal RNA-seq analysis pointing to altered metabolic processes, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis, as mediators of the pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognitive function. This link is further bolstered by recent reports that increasing metabolic function by supplementation with NAD + and its precursors confers cognitive benefits in aged rodents 27-29 , similar to the effects that we observed with NADH in the context of increased neuronal FTL1.\n\nExcess iron and its abnormal redox cycling can also lead to ferroptosis 30,31 , an iron-dependent programmed cell death pathway observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease 32,33 . Ferroptosis was previously characterized using Fe 2+ -specific and Fe 3+ -specific DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors, triggering an increase in both Fe 2+ or Fe 3+ as well as a concomitant decrease in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio 20 . The observed decrease in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio resulting from ferroptosis is distinct from the increase observed after neuronal FTL1 overexpression in the hippocampus. These contrasting observations are likely reflective of key differences between normal aging in the absence of gross neuronal death and neurodegenerative disease conditions in which ferroptosis is observed.\n\nAlterations in mitochondria dynamics are likewise widely reported in the brain during aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, with structural effects to the mitochondrial inner membrane disrupting the electron transport system by modifying the available surface area necessary for ATP synthesis to occur 34,35 . Both bulk neuronal RNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq after overexpression and abrogation of neuronal Ftl1 point toward changes in the electron transport system linked to potential structural modifications in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Indeed, Gene Ontology analysis of bidirectional, differentially expressed genes indicates fluctuations in proton-motive force, implicating changes in electron transport through complexes I, II and IV that are coupled to electrogenic proton ejection across the mitochondrial inner membrane. These transcriptional analyses are further bolstered by in vitro Seahorse analysis, demonstrating altered ATP production after FTL1 manipulation in primary neurons. Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1.\n\nFrom a translational perspective, aging is the most dominant risk factor for age-related neurodegenerative disorders 2,36,37 such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Of note, mutations in the Ftl1 gene result in neuroferritinopathy-a rare inherited late-onset monogenic neurodegenerative disorder associated with movement disorders, dystonia and cognitive impairments 38-40 . Moreover, longitudinal studies of patients with Alzheimer's disease showed that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively associated with cognitive performance over 7 years and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease 41 . Thus, our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/ftl1.md"}
{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Methods\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Tissue collection\n\nMice were anesthetized with 87.5 mg kg -1 ketamine and 12.5 mg kg -1 xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were removed and processed for subsequent analysis. To process the brains, either the hippocampus was subdissected and snap frozen or the whole brain was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00b0C for 48 hours before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Viral plasmids and viruses\n\nLentiviral constructs for Ftl1 overexpression, knockdown and conditional knockout were generated using standard molecular cloning techniques. For overexpression, murine Ftl1 coding sequence (with partial untranslated regions) was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from adult mouse hippocampal cDNA and cloned into pENTR-D-TOPO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. K240020), sequence verified and subcloned into a synapsin-IRES-eGFP lentiviral backbone using NheI\n\nand EcoRI. The synapsin-IRES-eGFP plasmid alone served as control. For knockdown, shRNAs targeting Ftl1 (SH1-SH4) were cloned into the pGreenPuro system (System Biosciences), with a luciferase-targeting shRNA as control 15,42 . For CRISPR-based knockout vectors, six gRNAs targeting Ftl1 exons 2-4 were designed using CHOPCHOP 43 and cloned into LentiCRISPR v2 (ref. 44). gRNA sequences included CGTATTTGTAACCTCCCGCA and CGCAGACTGGCGCGCCCCAG, among others. A non-targeting gRNA (GGCGAGGGCGATGCCACCTA) served as control. Validated gRNA sequences were subcloned into a Syn1 -Cre lentiviral vector (Addgene, no. 68841; ref. 45) using PacI and NheI/XbaI. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus production followed previously described protocols 46 . Ftl1 expression changes were confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot in mouse cells.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Confocal imaging and quantification\n\nFor hippocampal synaptic proteins, confocal images were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) with a \u00d763 objective as z stacks (16 optical sections, 0.33-\u00b5m step size) per sample. Maximum intensity projections were generated for individual puncta analysis. Synapsin (555 nm) and gephyrin or PSD95 (647 nm) were quantified using the Analysis module. For co-localization, z stacks were split into four approximately 1-\u00b5m sub-stacks, each projected to two dimensions. Co-localization was assessed using the ZEN Toolkit 3D. For primary cell cultures, confocal z stacks (12 sections, 0.80-\u00b5m step) were acquired on an LSM 900 microscope (Zeiss) using a \u00d720 objective. Neurite length was quantified with NeuronJ (version 1.4.3) and imagescience.jar in FIJI (ImageJ version 1.54f). Sholl analysis was performed using the Simple Neurite Tracer in the Neuroanatomy plugin. Concentric rings (10-\u00b5m spacing, up to 300 \u00b5m) centered on the soma were used to quantify dendrite complexity by counting neurite intersections, which were summed to calculate total arborization and plotted as a function of distance.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g).

However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Stereotaxic injections\n\nProcedures were adapted from Lin et al. 46 .

Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Neuronal nuclei isolation\n\nNeuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi following a modified version of Krishnaswami et al. 48 .

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Nuclei isolation for single-nucleus RNA-seq\n\nNeuronal nuclei were isolated from flash-frozen hippocampi using a modified version of the 10x Genomics protocol.

Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## FACS\n\nNuclei were sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion with a 70-\u00b5m nozzle and a flow rate of 1-2.5 ml min -1 .

Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## RNA-seq analysis\n\nReads were aligned to the mm10 mouse transcriptome using STAR version 2.7.3a 50 with ENCODE-recommended settings.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Synaptosomes protein sample preparation\n\nTo obtain sufficient synaptosomes for proteomic analysis, hippocampus and cortex from multiple mice were pooled. Synaptosomes were isolated following a modified protocol from Trinidad et al. 53 . Tissue was homogenized in sucrose buffer with phosphatase inhibitors (Na 3 VO4, NaF, Na2 MoO4, sodium tartrate, fenvalerate and okadaic acid) and PUGNAc, followed by differential centrifugation. Synaptic membranes were collected at the 1.0-1.2 M sucrose interface and pelleted. Frozen pellets were resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II/III and PUGNAc. Protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each sample (1.5 mg) was reduced with 2.5 mM TCEP at 56 \u00b0C for 1 hour, alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide (45 minutes, room temperature, dark), diluted to 1 M guanidine and digested overnight at 37 \u00b0C with sequencing-grade trypsin (1:50 enzyme:substrate). Peptides were acidified with formic acid, desalted (C18 Sep-Pak) and dried by SpeedVac. Tryptic peptides were labeled with TMT-6plex reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol: TMT126-131 for three young and three aged samples. Labeling efficiency was confirmed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap. Labeled peptides were quenched with 5% hydroxylamine, pooled, desalted and dried. Peptides were separated using high-pH reverse-phase chromatography on a Gemini 5-\u00b5m C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm; Phenomenex). A 9-49% acetonitrile gradient in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) was run over 20 ml at 550 \u00b5l min -1 , collecting 60 fractions. Fractions were combined (two per sample) into 12 final samples and dried for downstream analysis.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2).

To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g).

However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Mass spectrometry analysis\n\nTandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were separated on a 50-cm \u00d7 75-\u00b5m ID, 2-\u00b5m C18 EASY-Spray column using a linear gradient from 3.5% to 30% solvent B over 185 minutes. MS1 scans were acquired from 375 m / z to 1,500 m / z at 120,000 resolution (AGC target:\n\n4.0 \u00d7 10 5 ). Ions with charge states 2-7 were selected using a 1.0m / z window, with dynamic exclusion (30 seconds) and MIPS filtering enabled. Higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 spectra were acquired using stepped collision energies (30%/35%/40%) and detected in the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution (AGC: 5.0 \u00d7 10 4 ; maximum injection time: 100 ms). The scan cycle was set to 3 seconds. Peaklists were generated using Proteome Discoverer version 2.2 and searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus database (downloaded 6 September 2016, with decoy sequences) using Protein Prospector version 5.21.1. Searches assumed trypsin specificity with up to two missed cleavages. Fixed modifications included carbamidomethylation (Cys) and TMT-6plex labels (Lys and N termini); variable modifications included N-terminal acetylation, oxidation (Met), pyro-glutamate formation (Gln) and N-terminal Met loss (with or without acetylation). A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide was allowed. Identifications were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## TMT mass spectrometry data analysis\n\nData were filtered to only include peptides unique to a single protein. Quantitation of TMT data was performed by calculating ratios of reporter ion peak intensities between conditions along with variance for each ratio and median normalized. Protein abundances were normalized by the median of ratio distributions. The age-dependent changes were determined using a normalized median log 2 Aged/Young ratio of at least 1.0, corresponding to a 2.0 fold change with age and a -log 10 P value greater than 1.3.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Western blot analysis\n\nWestern blotting was performed on both mouse hippocampal tissue and primary hippocampal neurons. For tissue studies, hippocampi were dissected, flash frozen and pulverized prior to lysis in RIPA buffer (Abcam, ab156034) with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 4693116001). Lysates were mixed with 4\u00d7 LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008), resolved by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, 1:5,000), \u03b2-tubulin (Covance, MMS-435P, 1:1,000), NR2A (Sigma-Aldrich, 07-632, 1:1,000), synapsin (Abcam, ab18814, 1:1,000) and AMPA receptor (Abcam, ab109450, 1:3,000). HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A15999, 1:2,000) and anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, NA934V, 1:2,000) secondaries were used for detection with ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Signals were imaged with a ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad) and quantified in FIJI/ImageJ (version 2.0.0).\n\nFor cell-based experiments, primary neurons were cultured from E17 mouse embryos, treated as indicated, lysed under the same conditions and processed in parallel. Quantification was normalized to loading controls (GAPDH, \u03b2-tubulin or \u03b2-actin) and to the control group.

Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (24 hours, 4 \u00b0C), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (3 days) and sectioned coronally at\n\n30-\u00b5m thickness using a cryostat. Slices were stored at -20 \u00b0C in cryoprotectant. For each group, three sections from six mice per cohort were stained with technical replicates. Sections were rinsed in TBS (3\u00d7, 5 minutes), blocked in 2% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-GFP antibody (Aves Labs, cat. no. GFP-1020, 1:250).

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## DNAzyme sequences Fe(II)-H5\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Electrophysiology\n\nAcute hippocampal slices were prepared from 16-18-week-old male mice, 1 month after stereotaxic injection of Ftl1 -overexpressing (Ftl1 OE) or control virus. All procedures were approved by the IACUC of AfaSci (protocol no. 0223). Mice (28-42 g) were deeply anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; continuously bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2). ACSF composition (in mM) was as follows: 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 KH 2 PO4, 2.4 CaCl 2 , 1.3 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO3 and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Transverse hippocampal slices (400 \u00b5m) were prepared using a tissue slicer (Stoelting) and recovered for \u22651 hour at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF prior to recording. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in submerged slices perfused with oxygenated ACSF (flow rate: 1.75 ml min -1 ; DynaMAX pump) at room temperature. Glass microelectrodes (1-3 M\u2126, ACSF-filled) were positioned in the stratum radiatum of CA1 to record responses evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals via a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC, Inc.), placed approximately 100 \u00b5m apart. Stimuli were 0.2-ms biphasic pulses (0.4-ms total duration) delivered every 10 seconds. Input/ output (I-O) curves were generated using 23 increasing current steps\n\n(20-\u00b5A increments) from threshold (20-100 \u00b5A). Test pulse intensity was set to 30-50% of the maximal response. LTP was induced using two trains of 100-Hz stimulation (100 pulses, 1-second duration, 5 seconds apart). fEPSP slope was measured from the initial negative phase using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices). Data points represent the average of three consecutive sweeps. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated using a 50-ms interpulse interval as the ratio of the second to the first EPSP. Traces were low-pass filtered with a Gaussian filter (-3-dB cutoff: 1,260 Hz). Representative LTP traces are averages of six consecutive responses (1 minute, unfiltered). Recordings were completed within 8 hours of dissection. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4, Excel and StatView 5.0. LTP was expressed as percent of baseline; the final 5 minutes were averaged for group comparisons. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m.

Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c).

No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Open field\n\nMice were placed in the center of an open 40-cm \u00d7 40-cm square chamber (Kinder Scientific) with no cues or stimuli and allowed to move freely for 10 minutes.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).

To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Y maze\n\nSpatial recognition was evaluated in a Y maze as described previously.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 .

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e).

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## References\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Author contributions\n\n\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

{"prompt": "# PAPER EXCERPT:\n--- INTRODUCTION ---\n\n## Targeting iron-associated protein Ftl1 in the brain of old mice improves age-related cognitive impairment\n\nUnderstanding cellular and molecular drivers of age-related cognitive decline is necessary to identify targets to restore cognition at old age. Here we identify ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1), an iron-associated protein, as a pro-aging neuronal factor that impairs cognition. Using transcriptomic and mass spectrometry approaches, we detect an increase in neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus of aged mice, the levels of which correlate with cognitive decline. Mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1 in young mice alters labile iron oxidation states and promotes synaptic and cognitive features of hippocampal aging. Targeting neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampi of aged mice improves synaptic-related molecular changes and cognitive impairments. Using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing, we detect changes in metabolic processes, such as ATP synthesis, and boosting these metabolic functions through NADH supplementation mitigated pro-aging effects of neuronal FTL1 on cognition. Our data identify neuronal FTL1 as a key molecular mediator of cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nInvestigating the interplay between aging in the brain and the molecular and cellular changes that lead to cognitive decline is key to understand susceptibility to age-related neurodegenerative diseases 1,2 . We and others have begun to challenge longstanding views of brain aging as a rigid process by showing that rejuvenation is possible in animal models at old age 3-9 . Notwithstanding, to identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain. It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level 1,10 . Although various neuronal factors have been shown to change with age in the brain 1,11 , to date, only a small number have been demonstrated as functional drivers of age-related cognitive dysfunction 12-15 . Thus, we sought to identify pro-aging neuronal factors as molecular targets for cognitive rejuvenation.\n\nWe first investigated molecular changes in neurons that occur during aging in the hippocampus-a brain region regulating learning and memory and highly vulnerable to the effects of aging 11,13 using neuronal nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NeuN +  nuclei were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from hippocampi of young (3 months) and aged (18 months) mice (Fig. 1a), and transcriptional changes were assessed by RNA-seq. Transcriptomic analysis detected 28 genes with increased expression and 81 genes with decreased expression with age (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes predominantly identified synapse-related processes, such as regulation of synapse structure or activity and regulation of synapse assembly (Fig. 1b).\n\nTo gain insight into age-related molecular changes at the synaptic level, we performed comparative proteomics analysis of the synaptic fraction (synaptosome) in both young and aged mouse brains using isobaric tagging coupled with mass spectrometry (Fig. 1c). Due to technical limitations in the number of animals necessary to obtain\n\nsufficient amounts of isolated synaptosomes to conduct mass spectrometry analysis, we opted to sub-dissect and pool hippocampal and cortical tissue from mice. Proteomic analysis detected 27 proteins with increased abundance and 19 proteins with decreased abundance in aging (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 2). Gene Ontology analysis highlighted biological processes related to immune responses and complement activation, which are known to be associated with synaptic remodeling in neurons 16 (Fig. 1d).\n\nComparison of our neuronal transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets identified one factor with conserved increased expression: the iron-associated protein ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) 17-19 (Fig. 1e-g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To investigate the relationship between increased FTL1 and cognition, we correlated hippocampal FTL1 expression with cognitive performance on a battery of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks in an independent cohort of young and aged mice. We observed a significant negative association between increased hippocampal FTL1 expression by western blot and impaired overall cognitive performance\n\n(Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Table 3). These data identify FTL1 as a potential pro-aging neuronal factor with implications for cognitive dysfunction.\n\nTo assess the effect of mimicking an age-related increase in neuronal FTL1, we used a cell-type-specific, viral-mediated overexpression approach. Primary mouse neurons were infected with lentiviral constructs encoding either Ftl1 or green fluorescent protein (GFP)\n\nunder the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). We assessed morphological changes by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in the total neurite length and dendritic complexity of MAP2 + neurons overexpressing FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2a). No differences in neuronal cell density or toxicity were observed under FTL1 overexpression conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).\n\nHaving observed neuronal changes in vitro, we investigated the effect of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the adult hippocampus. Young mice were given bilateral stereotaxic injections of high-titer lentivirus encoding Ftl1 or GFP under the control of the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter into the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Increased FTL1 expression was validated by western blot (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo begin, we characterized changes in redox states of free iron (Fe) after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus using DNAzyme-based fluorescent turn-on sensors that are selective for either ferrous (Fe 2+ ) or ferric (Fe 3+ ) states 20 . Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ were detected simultaneously in the hippocampus, and an increase in Fe 3+ was observed in neurons overexpressing FTL1 (Fig. 2c). To further understand changes in iron redox cycling, we compared the relative Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ ratio and observed a concomitant increase after neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that increased FTL1 promotes accumulation of oxidized iron in hippocampal neurons.\n\nTo examine aging-associated synaptic alterations 14 , we assessed presynaptic and postsynaptic molecular markers after increased neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus. We assessed changes in synapses by immunocytochemical analysis and detected a decrease in PSD95 + excitatory and gephyrin + inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control (Fig. 2d,e). Additionally, we observed reduced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), AMPA receptor and synapsin by western blot (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with previously described age-related changes associated with impairments in synaptic plasticity 14 . Our data suggest that increasing neuronal FTL1 promotes aging-associated synaptic changes in the adult hippocampus.\n\nTo investigate the functional impact of increasing neuronal FTL1 in the hippocampus, we assessed long-term potentiation (LTP) and cognition in young mice after viral-mediated neuronal FTL1 overexpression (Fig. 2f-i). We performed extracellular electrophysiological recordings on hippocampal slices and observed lower LTP levels from the CA1 of young animals overexpressing neuronal FTL1 compared to control conditions (Fig. 2f). Hippocampal-dependent memory was assessed using novel object recognition (NOR) and forced alternation Y maze behavioral paradigms (Fig. 2g). During NOR and Y maze testing, control young mice were biased toward a novel object and the novel arm relative to a familiar condition (Fig. 2h,i). However, young mice with increased expression of neuronal FTL1 were cognitively impaired,\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Additional information\n\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z.\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Laura Remesal or Saul A.

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified 1-5 , concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in\u00a0vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies 6 to identify LSC-niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine-taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in\u00a0vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours 1-5,7-10 . While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours 11,12 , concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nAggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blastcrisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche 13-15 , their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia progression 6 . This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT-KITL and CD47-thrombospondin 1 16 , as well as multiple new signalling axes.\n\n\n\nOf these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6 , was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy 17 or support anti-cancer immunity 18 , a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Temporal changes in leukaemia niche\n\nTo define temporal changes in non-immune bone marrow microenvironment populations during myeloid leukaemia progression, we used bcCML LSCs, which can grow in unirradiated mouse recipients (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b). Bone marrow stromal populations (leukaemia CD45 TER119 ) were isolated from leukaemic cohorts at distinct stages of disease progression and analysed using scRNA-seq (Fig.\u00a01a). Gene-expression-based clustering identified 21 lineage clusters with transitional subsets covering endothelial cells, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and\n\nosteo-associated populations (Fig.\u00a01b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01c,d) and showed significant remodelling with disease progression (Fig.\u00a01c,d). Our flow-cytometry-based analyses of an independent cohort of leukaemic mice validated these changes, showing increases in MSCs, osteolineage and arteriolar endothelial cells, with a concomitant decline in sinusoidal endothelial populations (Fig.\u00a01e,f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e).\n\nClustering analyses of genes expressed in major lineages identified gene sets with similar changes in expression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01f), suggesting that these may represent altered stromal cell fate. Pathway analysis showed that osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization were downregulated in MSCs and osteo-associated cells, and focal adhesion and cell migration were downregulated in endothelial populations, indicating that MSC and endothelial function may be impaired with disease progression (Fig.\u00a01g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a). Collectively, our temporal analysis of the TME identifies dynamic changes in gene expression of stromal subpopulations during leukaemia progression.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified 1-5 , concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in\u00a0vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies 6 to identify LSC-niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine-taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in\u00a0vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours 1-5,7-10 . While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours 11,12 , concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nAggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blastcrisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche 13-15 , their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia progression 6 . This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT-KITL and CD47-thrombospondin 1 16 , as well as multiple new signalling axes.\n\n\n\nOf these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6 , was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy 17 or support anti-cancer immunity 18 , a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Ligand-receptor interactome\n\nTo define the functional relevance of microenvironmental changes on leukaemogenesis, we focused on proteins expressed on LSC cell surface that act as receptors for niche-driven signals. To identify LSC receptors associated with disease progression, we performed RNA-seq analysis of human AML and bcCML CD34 +  cells, and healthy donor bone marrow CD34 + haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs; Extended Data Fig.\u00a02b). We noted significant (adjusted P ( P adj ) &lt; 0.05) upregulation of 1,569 genes in bcCML, 2,842 genes in AML and 2,331 genes in both bcCML and AML compared with normal HSPCs. To identify signals that are functionally relevant for disease progression, we found cell surface genes 19 that drop out by twofold or more in our genome-wide in\u00a0vivo leukaemia CRISPR screen 6 . This identified 13 cell surface signals common to both bcCML and AML, 18 unique to AML and 7 unique to bcCML. Of these 38 genes, 16 were misannotated as cell surface in the reference dataset 19 and were removed from further analysis (Methods and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02c,d). We used NicheNet and the published literature to identify ligands for these receptors, especially those that were significantly upregulated in our TME scRNA-seq data and in the human AML immune microenvironment 20  (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02e). This led to the exclusion of receptors with no known ligands ( MR1 , TMCO3 and TSPAN15 ) as well as those of which the ligands were not significantly enriched in any TME population ( LGALS3BP , CD96 , CD274 and CD3D ). We therefore generated a unique map of TME ligands for 15 LSC receptors that are essential for disease progression (Fig.\u00a02a).\n\nWe next determined whether disease progression could alter the expression of LSC-specific TME ligands, and identified four distinct patterns of ligand expression. While the expression of some genes remained steady, for example, Jam2 in arteriolar endothelial cells and Ihh in chondrocytes, the expression of Vcam1 , Pcdh7 and Il7 was lost in the TME, especially at the end point. Expression of Anxa1 first increased but then declined towards the end. The fourth category of genes was always expressed, but the microenvironmental populations expressing them changed. These included Pvr , Cdo1 , Apoe and Agt (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a-d). Our analysis capturing dynamic changes in the TME identifies signals that may be necessary not only at different stages of disease progression, but also those critical during the entire course of disease.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## TME signals support leukaemogenesis\n\nMultiple TME-LSC signalling axes identified in our interactome may have a functional role in leukaemia progression. However, we were interested in genes associated with unfavourable outcomes in human patients with AML. Of the 22 genes upregulated in human LSCs, only low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) and SLC6A6 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML (Fig.\u00a02a-c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a,b). We therefore tested the functional requirement of\n\nTME-derived ligands of LDLR and SLC6A6 on LSC growth. One of the primary LDLR ligands, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 21 , was highly expressed in MSCs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d). To test the role of APOE from MSCs on LSC function, we co-cultured bcCML LSCs with MSCs transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apoe or LacZ (control; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c). Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d-f).\n\nSLC6A6 encodes TAUT, which has high affinity for the non-essential amino acid taurine, and low affinity for \u03b2-alanine (taurine K m = 4.5 \u03bcM versus \u03b2-alanine K m = 56 \u03bcM) 22 . Our experiments indicate that Slc6a6 expression can be directly induced by oncogenes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04g). While the leukaemia TME did not express enzymes required for \u03b2-alanine synthesis ( Gadl1 and Cndp1 ), those needed for taurine biosynthesis were expressed in osteo-associated cells ( Cdo1 and Csad ; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04h,i). Our analysis of\u00a0publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients 23 showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j). To test whether CDO1 is expressed in the human leukaemia TME, we performed an scRNA-seq analysis of CD45 -stromal cells from three myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML bone marrow aspirates. Our analysis of the limited numbers of stromal cells in these samples indicate that CDO1 expression is restricted to the MSC/osteolineage cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04k,l), as we\u00a0see in mouse samples. Notably, we found a marked increase in CDO1 protein expression in nearly all matched biopsies of patients who progressed from MDS to secondary AML, and those who relapsed after AML diagnosis (Fig.\u00a02d-g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04m-p). While CDO1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated human AML MSCs, its expression increased during in\u00a0vitro mouse and human AML MSC osteogenic differentiation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a-c). Thus, CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow. Importantly, taurine levels in extracellular medium increased during MSC differentiation, indicating that elevated CDO1 expression is correlated with taurine production (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05d).\n\nTo determine a functional role of taurine from osteolineage cells, we tested the impact of inhibiting taurine biosynthesis in mouse and human leukaemia bone-marrow-derived MSCs on co-cultured leukaemia cells. Our experiments showed that mouse LSCs co-cultured with osteolineage cells lacking Cdo1 expression were significantly less viable (about 2-fold lower than the controls) and formed fewer colonies (3.4-fold less than controls), which could be rescued by supplementing cultures with taurine (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e-g). Similarly, inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig.\u00a02h,i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h), indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival.\n\nConsistent with a functional role of taurine from the TME in leukaemia progression, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a02j). In mice, the majority of taurine is synthesized in the liver from cysteine 24 . To determine whether taurine produced locally in the bone marrow niche is essential for leukaemia growth, we generated\u00a0a new Cdo1 fl/fl mouse model and crossed it to MSC/osteolineage-specific Prrx1-cre mice (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05i-k). We used these as recipients for LSCs and monitored survival, and the impact on bone marrow microenvironment populations. Our experiments showed that Cdo1 fl/fl Prrx1-cre + mice lived around 13.5% longer than the controls, indicating that taurine produced locally in the leukaemia TME can support disease progression, at least in part (Fig.\u00a02k). We did not find any significant changes in the composition of TME in Cdo1 fl/fl Prrx1-cre + leukaemic mice as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05l-n), suggesting that leukaemia-driven remodelling of the bone marrow niche does not depend on taurine produced\n\nby osteolineage cells. We finally tested whether exogenous taurine supplements can promote leukaemia growth. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of mouse LSCs and patient-derived AML cells increased by 1.2- to 3.3-fold in the presence of taurine (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05o-q). Taurine supplements could significantly accelerate\n\ndisease progression in immunocompetent mice (around threefold higher likelihood of death relative to the controls; Extended Data Fig.\u00a05r), indicating that taurine can promote leukaemic progression.\n\nCollectively, these data indicate a key role of taurine and APOE from the bone marrow niche in sustaining LSCs. As SLC6A6 expression was\n\nsignificantly enriched in both human bcCML and AML LSCs as compared to the controls, we focused our studies on SLC6A6, as it may be broadly required for growth of aggressive leukaemias.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

However, we were interested in genes associated with unfavourable outcomes in human patients with AML. Of the 22 genes upregulated in human LSCs, only low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) and SLC6A6 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in AML (Fig.\u00a02a-c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a,b). We therefore tested the functional requirement of\n\nTME-derived ligands of LDLR and SLC6A6 on LSC growth. One of the primary LDLR ligands, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 21 , was highly expressed in MSCs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d). To test the role of APOE from MSCs on LSC function, we co-cultured bcCML LSCs with MSCs transduced with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Apoe or LacZ (control; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c). Co-culture with MSCs lacking Apoe expression led to significant reduction in both the viability and colony-forming ability of LSCs (around 2.1-fold lower than the controls; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04d-f).\n\nSLC6A6 encodes TAUT, which has high affinity for the non-essential amino acid taurine, and low affinity for \u03b2-alanine (taurine K m = 4.5 \u03bcM versus \u03b2-alanine K m = 56 \u03bcM) 22 . Our experiments indicate that Slc6a6 expression can be directly induced by oncogenes (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04g). While the leukaemia TME did not express enzymes required for \u03b2-alanine synthesis ( Gadl1 and Cndp1 ), those needed for taurine biosynthesis were expressed in osteo-associated cells ( Cdo1 and Csad ; Extended Data Fig.\u00a04h,i). Our analysis of\u00a0publicly available human bone marrow stromal cell scRNA-seq data using surgical samples from osteoarthritis patients 23 showed that CDO1 expression is restricted to MSC and osteolineage populations (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04j). To test whether CDO1 is expressed in the human leukaemia TME, we performed an scRNA-seq analysis of CD45 -stromal cells from three myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML bone marrow aspirates. Our analysis of the limited numbers of stromal cells in these samples indicate that CDO1 expression is restricted to the MSC/osteolineage cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04k,l), as we\u00a0see in mouse samples. Notably, we found a marked increase in CDO1 protein expression in nearly all matched biopsies of patients who progressed from MDS to secondary AML, and those who relapsed after AML diagnosis (Fig.\u00a02d-g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04m-p). While CDO1 protein was expressed in undifferentiated human AML MSCs, its expression increased during in\u00a0vitro mouse and human AML MSC osteogenic differentiation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a-c). Thus, CDO1 may be broadly expressed in immature MSCs as well as differentiating osteolineage cells in human bone marrow. Importantly, taurine levels in extracellular medium increased during MSC differentiation, indicating that elevated CDO1 expression is correlated with taurine production (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05d).\n\nTo determine a functional role of taurine from osteolineage cells, we tested the impact of inhibiting taurine biosynthesis in mouse and human leukaemia bone-marrow-derived MSCs on co-cultured leukaemia cells.

Similarly, inhibiting CDO1 in osteolineage cultures from MSCs derived from patients with AML impaired survival and colony-formation of co-cultured AML cells from the same patient by 2- to 3.2-fold (Fig.\u00a02h,i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h), indicating that taurine produced by osteolineage cells promotes LSC growth and survival.\n\nConsistent with a functional role of taurine from the TME in leukaemia progression, taurine levels were 1.7-fold higher in leukaemic bone marrow interstitial fluid as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a02j).

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified 1-5 , concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in\u00a0vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies 6 to identify LSC-niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine-taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in\u00a0vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours 1-5,7-10 . While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours 11,12 , concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nAggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blastcrisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche 13-15 , their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia progression 6 . This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT-KITL and CD47-thrombospondin 1 16 , as well as multiple new signalling axes.\n\n\n\nOf these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6 , was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy 17 or support anti-cancer immunity 18 , a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis\n\nTo determine whether TAUT has a functional role in leukaemia progression we used global Slc6a6 -knockout mice 25 (Fig.\u00a03a,b). While Slc6a6 -knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios, they can develop ageing-related defects in bone mass and retinal degeneration 25-27 . Our experiments showed that TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being\n\nproduced by the niche. TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability (Fig.\u00a03e), as well as a marked increase in the survival of mice transplanted with Slc6a6 -/-LSCs (40%) relative to control LSCs (0%) in secondary transplant assays (21.2-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03f). The 8.5-fold reduction in colony-forming ability of bcCML LSCs from secondary transplants suggests that these leukaemias remain dependent on TAUT expression and taurine uptake for their continued propagation (Fig.\u00a03g,h). We noted no significant differences in bone marrow microenvironmental populations of mice bearing Slc6a6 -/-leukaemias as compared to the controls, indicating that leukaemia-driven niche remodelling possibly\n\n\n\nreflects the extent of the tumour burden, and may be independent of taurine levels within leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c-g).\n\nTo determine whether TAUT is broadly required for de\u00a0novo AML growth, we tested the impact of its loss on initiation of leukaemia driven by MLL-AF9/NRAS(G12V) and by AML-ETO9a/NRAS(G12V). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03i-k). Slc6a6 -/-KIT + AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig.\u00a03l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs. Consistent with a key role of TAUT expression in myeloid leukaemia initiation, TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03m,n). At the cellular level, TAUT loss led to a 2.4- to 3.6-fold reduction in primitive Lin -CD150 FLT3 + SCA1 + LSCs 6 (Fig.\u00a03o). Furthermore, TAUT loss increased necrosis and the\u00a0Lin + differentiated cells (Fig.\u00a03p and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a03q). These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\n\nWe next tested the impact of TAUT loss on normal haematopoiesis. Our analysis indicates that TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady-state (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a-e). While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f,g). Although overall bone marrow chimerism 4 months after transplant was 2.4-fold lower in Slc6a6 -/-HSC recipients as compared to Slc6a6 +/+ HSC recipients, these Slc6a6 -/-HSCs were able to contribute to all haematopoietic lineages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07h-k). Serial transplantation of Slc6a6 +/+ and Slc6a6 -/bone marrow cells showed a similar loss in Slc6a6 -/-engraftment over time (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07l-q). These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC-enriched genes such as CD98 1 , STAU2 6 , MSI2 28,29 , BRD4 30 and BCL2 31 can impair HSC self-renewal. However, therapeutic inhibition of CD98 showed minimal toxicity in AML phase I trials 1 and BCL2 inhibitors are approved for AML therapy. It is therefore possible that non-genetic approaches using small-molecule inhibitors or gene silencing may identify a therapeutic window for TAUT targeting in human cells. We therefore tested the impact of TAUT inhibition on growth and proliferation of normal human HSPCs as well as patient-derived AML cells.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

While Slc6a6 -knockout mice are born at Mendelian ratios, they can develop ageing-related defects in bone mass and retinal degeneration 25-27 . Our experiments showed that TAUT loss in LSCs significantly reduced their ability to grow when co-cultured with osteolineage cells expressing either control shRNA or shRNA against Cdo1 (shCdo1; Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a), indicating that they could not respond to taurine being\n\nproduced by the niche. TAUT loss impaired initiation of bcCML in mouse models (3.9-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03c,d), which could not be rescued with taurine supplements (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). TAUT loss also led to functional depletion in bcCML LSCs, as indicated by a 2.3-fold reduction in their colony-forming ability (Fig.\u00a03e), as well as a marked increase in the survival of mice transplanted with Slc6a6 -/-LSCs (40%) relative to control LSCs (0%) in secondary transplant assays (21.2-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03f). The 8.5-fold reduction in colony-forming ability of bcCML LSCs from secondary transplants suggests that these leukaemias remain dependent on TAUT expression and taurine uptake for their continued propagation (Fig.\u00a03g,h). We noted no significant differences in bone marrow microenvironmental populations of mice bearing Slc6a6 -/-leukaemias as compared to the controls, indicating that leukaemia-driven niche remodelling possibly\n\n\n\nreflects the extent of the tumour burden, and may be independent of taurine levels within leukaemia cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c-g).\n\nTo determine whether TAUT is broadly required for de\u00a0novo AML growth, we tested the impact of its loss on initiation of leukaemia driven by MLL-AF9/NRAS(G12V) and by AML-ETO9a/NRAS(G12V). Our experiments showed that TAUT loss markedly delays the initiation of MLL-driven AML relative to the control (6.1-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03i-k). Slc6a6 -/-KIT + AML LSCs from established disease formed 2.9-fold fewer colonies compared with the controls (Fig.\u00a03l), indicating that TAUT loss depleted functional LSCs. Consistent with a key role of TAUT expression in myeloid leukaemia initiation, TAUT loss in disease driven by AML-ETO9a resulted in a marked increase in survival (70%) relative to the controls (0%) (36.3-fold higher likelihood of survival; Fig.\u00a03m,n). At the cellular level, TAUT loss led to a 2.4- to 3.6-fold reduction in primitive Lin -CD150 FLT3 + SCA1 + LSCs 6 (Fig.\u00a03o). Furthermore, TAUT loss increased necrosis and the\u00a0Lin + differentiated cells (Fig.\u00a03p and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06h) and promoted cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a03q). These data demonstrate a critical requirement for TAUT in the initiation, self-renewal and propagation of myeloid leukaemia.\n\nWe next tested the impact of TAUT loss on normal haematopoiesis. Our analysis indicates that TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady-state (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a-e). While TAUT loss did not impair initial HSC engraftment (1 month after transplant), donor chimerism dropped over time (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f,g). Although overall bone marrow chimerism 4 months after transplant was 2.4-fold lower in Slc6a6 -/-HSC recipients as compared to Slc6a6 +/+ HSC recipients, these Slc6a6 -/-HSCs were able to contribute to all haematopoietic lineages (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07h-k). Serial transplantation of Slc6a6 +/+ and Slc6a6 -/bone marrow cells showed a similar loss in Slc6a6 -/-engraftment over time (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07l-q). These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady-state haematopoiesis, it can impact long-term HSC self-renewal and maintenance. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC-enriched genes such as CD98 1 , STAU2 6 , MSI2 28,29 , BRD4 30 and BCL2 31 can impair HSC self-renewal. However, therapeutic inhibition of CD98 showed minimal toxicity in AML phase I trials 1 and BCL2 inhibitors are approved for AML therapy. It is therefore possible that non-genetic approaches using small-molecule inhibitors or gene silencing may identify a therapeutic window for TAUT targeting in human cells. We therefore tested the impact of TAUT inhibition on growth and proliferation of normal human HSPCs as well as patient-derived AML cells.", "from": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/casestudies/markdown/taurine.md"}

Although some niche-driven signals that promote cancer progression have been identified 1-5 , concerted efforts to map disease-relevant microenvironmental ligands of cancer stem cell receptors have been lacking. Here, we use temporal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify molecular cues from the bone marrow stromal niche that engage leukaemia stem-enriched cells (LSCs) during oncogenic progression. We integrate these data with our human LSC RNA-seq and in\u00a0vivo CRISPR screen of LSC dependencies 6 to identify LSC-niche interactions that are essential for leukaemogenesis. These analyses identify the taurine-taurine transporter (TAUT) axis as a critical dependency of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. We find that cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1)driven taurine biosynthesis is restricted to osteolineage cells, and increases during myeloid disease progression. Blocking CDO1 expression in osteolineage cells impairs LSC growth and improves survival outcomes. Using TAUT genetic loss-of-function mouse models and patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells, we show that TAUT inhibition significantly impairs in\u00a0vivo myeloid leukaemia progression. Consistent with elevated TAUT expression in venetoclax-resistant AML, TAUT inhibition synergizes with venetoclax to block the growth of primary human AML cells. Mechanistically, our multiomic approaches indicate that the loss of taurine uptake inhibits RAG-GTP dependent mTOR activation and downstream glycolysis. Collectively, our work establishes the temporal landscape of stromal signals during leukaemia progression and identifies taurine as a key regulator of myeloid malignancies.\n\nSignals from the tumour microenvironment (TME) can regulate initiation, progression and immune evasion of tumours 1-5,7-10 . While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours 11,12 , concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nAggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blastcrisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche 13-15 , their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia progression 6 . This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT-KITL and CD47-thrombospondin 1 16 , as well as multiple new signalling axes.\n\n\n\nOf these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6 , was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy 17 or support anti-cancer immunity 18 , a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## TAUT is essential for human AML growth\n\nOur analyses of available gene expression datasets indicate that SLC6A6 expression is enriched in leukaemia stem/progenitors as compared to more mature blasts (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a). While SLC6A6 is broadly expressed in AML irrespective of karyotype or FAB subtype (TCGA; Extended Data Fig.\u00a08b), increased expression correlates with venetoclax resistance (BEAT-AML; Fig.\u00a04a). SLC6A6 expression is also enriched in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-low LSCs from human monocytic AMLs (subtype clinically associated with venetoclax resistance; CD45 bright SSC high CD117 CD11b + CD68 + ) compared with primitive AML (Fig.\u00a04b; CD45 med SSC low CD117 + CD11b CD68 - ) 32 .  We find increased SLC6A6 expression in leukaemia cells carrying RAS mutations as compared to wild-type cells, consistent with data correlating RAS mutations with venetoclax resistance 33 (Fig.\u00a04c). SLC6A6 is also highly expressed in relapsed AML originating from stem/progenitor like cells compared with more committed populations 34 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c). These data collectively indicate that inhibiting SLC6A6 may be of value across AML subtypes, including those commonly associated with venetoclax resistance.\n\nTo determine whether small-molecule inhibitors of TAUT can effectively block leukaemia growth, we used two well-characterized structural analogues of taurine that inhibit uptake: 6-aminomethyl3-methyl-4H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide hydrochloride 35 (TAG) and guanidinoethyl sulphonate 36 (GES; Extended Data Fig.\u00a08d,e). TAG and GES treatment led to a substantial reduction in colonies formed by Slc6a6 +/+ mouse LSCs but not Slc6a6 -/-cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08f-h). Importantly, while TAG and GES impaired growth of primary human AML cells in colony assays by 1.8- to 20-fold, they did not impact normal human CD34 +  HSPC colony growth (Fig.\u00a04d,e). We next tested whether venetoclax can exacerbate the impact of TAUT loss and/or inhibition on LSC function. Our experiments showed that venetoclax reduced the viability of mouse Slc6a6 -/-LSCs by 3.2-fold and lowered their colony formation by 13.2-fold as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08i,j). While TAG, GES or venetoclax alone could impair mouse LSC colony formation by 1.4- to 3.9-fold, their combination was synergistic and led to 2.3- to 7.2-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08k-m). While primary human AML cells that were treated with GES, TAG or venetoclax alone formed 1.3- to 8.3-fold fewer colonies as compared to the controls, combining the treatments substantially impaired colony formation by 2.4- to 150-fold. These data indicate that taurine inhibitors can synergize with venetoclax in blocking the growth of human AML cells (Fig.\u00a04f-h).\n\nAs TAG and GES did not effectively block taurine uptake in\u00a0vivo (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a-j), we used shRNA-based approaches to determine the impact of inhibiting TAUT expression on human AML growth. Knocking down SLC6A6 expression using two independent shRNAs significantly impaired taurine uptake by 2.2 to 3.4-fold, as well as the colony-forming ability of human bcCML, AML and MDS cell lines by 2- to 12-fold (Extended Data Fig.\u00a09k-p). Our experiments showed that SLC6A6 knockdown in samples from patients with AML reduced their colony-forming ability by 2.33- to 9.12-fold as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a04i). By contrast, SLC6A6 knockdown did not impact colonies formed by normal human CD34 +  HSPCs (Fig.\u00a04j). Importantly, while SLC6A6 knockdown reduced the engraftment of primary AML cells by 1.2- to 40-fold in patient-derived xenograft models (Fig.\u00a04k,l), it did not significantly impair engraftment of normal human CD34 + HSPCs in xenograft models (Fig.\u00a04m).\n\nCollectively, our data identify a critical requirement for SLC6A6 expression in primary human AML growth and indicate that blocking taurine transport may be of value in aggressive myeloid leukaemias.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.

While scRNA-seq analysis has identified cellular TME components, especially in solid tumours 11,12 , concerted efforts to link ligands from the changing TME landscape with cognate receptors on cancer cells have been lacking. As cell surface proteins are particularly amenable to therapeutic targeting, functional characterization of their interactions with the TME are of considerable clinical interest.\n\nAggressive therapy-resistant myeloid leukaemias, such as blastcrisis-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (bcCML) and AML, initiate and expand in a complex bone marrow microenvironment. Although previous studies have described the cellular composition of normal bone marrow niche 13-15 , their dynamic alterations during leukaemia progression remain undefined. We use scRNA-seq to establish temporal changes in bone marrow microenvironment populations, and in niche-driven signals during disease progression. To define TME ligands that are essential for leukaemogenesis, we focused on cognate cell surface receptors enriched in LSCs as compared to healthy controls, and those essential for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia progression 6 . This approach identified signals that are known to be critical for cancer growth, such as KIT-KITL and CD47-thrombospondin 1 16 , as well as multiple new signalling axes.\n\n\n\nOf these signals, TAUT, encoded by SLC6A6 , was strongly associated with poor prognosis in human leukaemias and emerged as a key regulator of AML. As taurine can be neuroprotective, mitigate the side-effects of chemotherapy 17 or support anti-cancer immunity 18 , a cancer-promoting role of taurine has not been considered. We examined if blocking taurine production in the TME impairs LSC function. We used genetic tools to establish whether TAUT expression in cancer cells controls the growth of aggressive myeloid leukaemias. Using metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identify downstream mechanisms by which taurine regulates leukaemia growth.\n\n--- RESULTS ---\n\n## Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia\n\nTo establish the mechanisms by which taurine uptake in leukaemia cells promotes disease progression, we determined metabolic changes in the absence of taurine. Our untargeted metabolomic analysis of mouse LSCs identified significant downregulation of glycolysis/TCA related pathways and metabolites such as pyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate in Slc6a6 -/-cells, suggesting that taurine may regulate energy metabolism (Fig.\u00a05a-c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a010a). Consistent with this, we noted a 1.3- to 1.8-fold reduction in basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, maximal oxygen consumption and spare respiratory capacity in Slc6a6 -/-LSCs as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a05d,e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a010b). To functionally test the role of glycolysis and TCA associated metabolites, we determined whether bypassing these could rescue Slc6a6 -/-defects. Our experiments showed that the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 -/-LSCs could be significantly rescued by pyruvate, sodium acetate and lactate, but not glucagon (Fig.\u00a05f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a010c-e). These data suggest that glycolysis, and not gluconeogenesis, is the primary downstream effector of taurine in leukaemia cells.\n\nWe next tested whether taurine contributed to any cellular metabolite by determining 13 C-taurine incorporation in K562 leukaemia cells. Our untargeted metabolomic approach identified 13 C label only in known taurine conjugates, N -acetyl taurine and glutaurine (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010f,g). Membrane-permeable taurine fully rescued colonies formed\n\nby Slc6a6 -/-cells (Fig.\u00a05g), and N -acetyl-taurine partly rescued this defect (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010h), perhaps by breakdown to taurine and acetate 37 . By contrast, glutaurine was unable to rescue the Slc6a6 -/-colony formation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010i). These experiments indicate that taurine, and not a secondary metabolite, promotes leukaemia growth due to an indirect effect on glycolysis, possibly through downstream signalling.\n\nmouse leukaemia cells (Fig.\u00a05h). Our RNA-seq analysis identified 932 downregulated and 1,158 upregulated genes in the absence of TAUT ( P adj &lt; 0.05). The 1,158 upregulated genes included pathways associated with haematopoietic cell lineage and cell cycle regulation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a011a,b). The 932 downregulated genes primarily constituted pathways associated with glycolysis (Fig.\u00a05i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a011b-d), consistent with reduced abundance of glycolysis associated metabolites in these cells (Fig.\u00a05c). To determine effectors of glycolytic\n\ndownregulation on TAUT loss, we performed gene set enrichment analysis. This identified profound downregulation of oncogenic MYC and mTOR pathways (Fig.\u00a05j and Extended Data Fig.\u00a011c).\n\nAs mTOR signalling is known to\u00a0regulate expression of glycolysisrelated genes 38 , we tested whether TAUT loss impairs mTOR activation. Western blot analysis showed that TAUT loss results in a 2.2- to 3-fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig.\u00a05k-m and Extended Data Fig.\u00a011e). Our global phosphoproteome and total-proteome analyses also showed reduced expression of phosphorylated proteins associated with mTOR signalling, as well as 3.3-fold reduced BCL2 and 1.5-fold increased LC3A expression in the absence of TAUT (Extended Data Fig.\u00a011f,g). Like TAUT loss, TAUT inhibition with TAG and GES downregulated glycolysis-related gene expression (Extended Data Fig.\u00a011h,i) and impaired phosphorylation of mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012a,b). Consistent with a direct impact of taurine on mTOR signalling, acute treatment in\u00a0vitro and long-term taurine dosing in\u00a0vivo could activate mTOR signalling (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012c-h). Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin impaired the growth of wild-type cells but did not impact Slc6a6 -/-cells in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo (Fig.\u00a05n and Extended Data Fig.\u00a012i,k). By contrast, mTOR activation with MHY1485 39 rescued the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 -/-LSCs to 60% of the control, and membrane-permeable taurine rescued mTOR activation (Fig.\u00a05o and Extended Data Fig.\u00a012j-l). Collectively, these data indicate that mTOR signalling has a key role downstream of taurine in leukaemia cells.\n\nAmino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane 40 and its interaction with RHEB GTPases 41 , thereby promoting mTORC1 activation. We hypothesized that taurine may activate mTOR by promoting its interaction with RAG GTPases. To test this, we determined the effect of expressing constitutively active RAGA(Q66L) or RHEB(Q64L) on the colony-forming ability of Slc6a6 wild-type and null cells. Our experiments showed that, while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6 -/-colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig.\u00a05p). Furthermore, mTOR phosphorylation in Slc6a6 -/-cells could be rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012m). Finally, we directly tested whether taurine could promote mTOR interactions with lysosomes in wild-type and Slc6a6 -/leukaemia cells expressing RAGA(Q66L) (Fig.\u00a05q). Our immunofluorescence-based analysis showed that, at the baseline, Slc6a6 -/-cells have 1.2-fold lower mTOR-LAMP1 interaction, which could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L). Taurine supplements increased mTOR-LAMP1 co-localization to levels seen in cells expressing RAGA(Q66L). However, this interaction could not be increased further by adding taurine to RAGA(Q66L)-expressing cells (Fig.\u00a05r,s), consistent with our colony-forming assays (Extended Data Fig.\u00a012n).\n\nCollectively, our studies show that the taurine-TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG-mediated activation of mTOR signalling.\n\n# TASK:\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt.
