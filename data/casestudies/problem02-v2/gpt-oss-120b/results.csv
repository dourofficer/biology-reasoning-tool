CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo,"Elevated CREM expression in post‑infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14).","The well‑established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway (Ref: 15‑18) and previous research highlighting the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20).","Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR‑NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells,CREM expression was highest in metastatic TI‑NK cells compared with PBMCs or primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and correlated with poor survival in several cancers (Extended Data Fig. 5f).,CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28).,"Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI‑NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced through the PKA–CREB axis,"Pretreatment of NK cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, strongly inhibited CAR‑induced CREB phosphorylation and CREM induction after CAR ligation (Fig. 2b–d).","CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM.",These data provide support for a pivotal role of the PKA‑CREB axis in CREM upregulation in response to CD3ζ or IL‑15 stimulation.
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,"CREM KO led to both the up‑regulation and down‑regulation of direct CREM target genes, a result that underscores its context‑specific regulatory functions (Extended Data Fig. 11c).",Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue‑specific and cell‑specific expression (Ref: 35).,"Together, these data suggest that CREM contributes to NK cell dysfunction by directly binding and up‑regulating exhaustion and stress‑related genes while suppressing pathways essential for NK cell function and proliferation."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN‑related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1‑JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70‑IL‑15 NK cells, whereas ETS‑related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i).",These patterns of enriched AP‑1 and closed ETS motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long‑lived memory T cells (Ref: 40).,These patterns of enriched AP‑1 and closed ETS motifs may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR‑NK cells.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,Interface cells downregulated MITF and SOX10 and upregulated SOX9 (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1g).,"MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log₂FC = 5.15), NNAT (log₂FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log₂FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log₂FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).","MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation (Ref: 9,10), whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state (Ref: 11).",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement induces a neuronal state,"Tumour cells invading into the TME showed elongated nuclei compared with the bulk tumour mass (Fig. 1j, k).",A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).,We hypothesized that mechanical forces exerted on the cell/nucleus may cause stable changes in gene expression and tumour cell behaviour.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).",This was reminiscent of a previous study that showed that MTs bend to prevent buckling or rupture in response to force (Ref: 16).,These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 × 10⁻¹²; Fig. 2f-h).,Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).,"These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Most MTs in confined and unconfined A375 cells were highly tyrosinated (Extended Data Fig. 4a-d), probably owing to the high concentrations of tyrosine and tyrosinase in melanoma (Ref: 27).",Detyrosination has been linked to stabilized MTs (Ref: 26).,This indicates that acetylation is the primary PTM mediating the assembly and/or stability of the perinuclear tubulin network.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2,"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).",High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).,indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2,"We also examined the concentrations of HMG family members HMGB1 and HMGA1, which were transcriptionally upregulated in interface cells to a lesser extent than HMGB2, and quantified no change in their expression upon confinement (Extended Data Fig. 5c-f).",High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).,indicating that confinement-induced upregulation of HMGB2 is not a general property of all HMG family members.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"Targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).","Nesprin 2 is a component of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that connects the cytoskeleton, nuclear lamina and chromatin (Ref: 36).",This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,Tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 × 10⁻⁷) and the rate of accumulation ...; Taxol (100 nM) significantly increased HMGB2 accumulation in confined cells (P = 0.00230).,Tubulin acetylation stabilizes MTs and thus the cell against mechanical pressure (Ref: 19).,"These results indicate that confinement-induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3‑fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁶²; ...) and AFM showed increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g).",The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).,"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex‑mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Force affects HMGB2‑chromatin dynamics,Confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower‑diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 ± 0.39% versus 4.21 ± 0.39%; P = 1.134 × 10⁻⁵; Fig. 4f).,"FRAP recovery curves fitted well to a two‑component exponential equation ... indicating two pools of nuclear HMGB2: fast‑diffusing (stochastic interactions with chromatin) and slower‑diffusing (more specific, stable interactions) (Ref: 39).","suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2‑chromatin interactions in confined cells."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Force affects HMGB2‑chromatin dynamics,Our results indicate that the LINC complex and tubulin cytoskeleton cooperate to stabilize the nucleus against mechanical stress and upregulate HMGB2.,HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).,Confinement‑induced nuclear shape changes could thus increase the strain on chromatin and create a densely packed nuclear environment that affects HMGB2 dynamics.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 targets plasticity‑associated loci,ATAC sequencing of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g).,"The top‑ranked motif was an AP‑1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 × 10⁻⁴⁹), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).","These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement‑induced dedifferentiation program."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2,"HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes ... Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain‑2 (BRN2), a well‑characterized pro‑invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50).","Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain‑2 (BRN2), a well‑characterized pro‑invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50).",This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2‑mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,"Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol‑induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d).",Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell‑cycle arrest (Ref: 60).,"indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro‑invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, ...).","Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2).","Together, our results support a role for confinement‑mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro‑invasive and drug‑tolerant state in melanoma."
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,Dependency on mitochondrial respiration,"Treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (50 µM) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f). This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition.",Metformin—a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18).,"This effect was rescued by expression of NDI1, thus confirming that the effect of metformin was due to on-target complex I inhibition."
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,Metformin suppresses human mutant HSPCs,Metformin treatment reduced the competitive advantage of DNMT3A‑KD HSPCs (Fig. 5b). This effect was mitigated by the co‑expression of NDI1.,Metformin—a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18).,"Metformin suppresses the competitive advantage of DNMT3A‑KD HSPCs, and this effect is mediated through inhibition of complex I."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors,"Tumour-associated BM myeloid progenitors and Ly6Chi monocytes also had higher gene signature scores for oxidative stress response and ER stress response (Fig. 1c) while exhibiting increased cellular ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial oxidative stress as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d).","The ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria–ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo‑responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22) are known mechanisms involved in myelopoiesis.","These results collectively suggested that tumour-associated myelopoiesis drives priming of pathways in BM GMPs involved in the ROS stress response (Ref: 20), mitochondria–ER metabolic adaptations (Ref: 21) and IFN hypo‑responsiveness to limit exhaustion (Ref: 22)."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors,"We observed a marked increase in long‑term haematopoietic stem cells (LT‑HSC), multipotent common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocytic‑monocytic progenitors (GMP) and committed monocyte progenitor (cMoP) by flow cytometry in BM of advanced KP tumour‑bearing mice (Fig. 1a) alongside an increase in more mature myeloid populations (Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a).","Tumour‑driven myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5‑8) and supported in other datasets of tumour‑driven myelopoiesis (Ref: 12,13).","Thus, cancer‑associated inflammation provokes demand‑adapted mobilization of myeloid‑biased progenitors associated with oxidative stress‑responsive epigenomic remodelling."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs,"We adoptively transferred GMPs from either tumour‑bearing mice or naive mice into a tumour‑bearing congenic host ... we found mo‑macs derived from tumour‑primed GMPs to be more immunoregulatory in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo‑macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD‑L1, increased ARG1+ mo‑macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo‑macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a‑c).",Monocyte‑derived macrophages (mo‑macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1) and tumour‑enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations (Ref: 2).,These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs,"TFs for oxidative stress response, including Nfe2l2, Fosl2 and Bach1, were specifically enriched in tumour‑dominant ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo‑macs. Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating KP tumours exhibited a higher oxidative stress burden (Extended Data Fig. 3f) and intratumoural TREM2hi mo‑macs had relatively higher amounts of cytosolic ROS when compared with immunostimulatory mo‑macs (Extended Data Fig. 3g).",ROS stress response pathways are known to prime cytoprotective chromatin changes (Ref: 20).,These results suggested that oxidative stress‑induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour‑educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo‑macs.
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME,"We implanted lung tumours in Mx1GFP IFN‑sensitive response element reporter mice (Ref: 42). Here tumour‑associated monocytes across tissue compartments and tumoural mo‑macs had consistently lower GFP expression than their naive counterparts, indicating lower IFN responsiveness (Extended Data Fig. 5c). There was a stepwise increase in Mx1GFP as monocytes infiltrated the tumour, followed by waning in TME mo‑macs concomitant with NRF2 activation (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).",NRF2 can also directly influence pro‑inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30‑33).,"These results collectively suggested that exposure of BM myeloid progenitors to tumour cues primes NRF2 response loci and certain immunosuppressive gene loci, which promotes a more immunoregulatory fate for mo‑macs in the TME with a dampened type I or III IFN response."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME,"Exposing BMDMs from NRF2 constitutive knockout mice (Nfe2l2TKO) or wild‑type counterparts to KP CM resulted in lower Arg1, Retnla and Chil3 expression and higher ISGs Mx1 and Nos2 (Fig. 3a). Viable tumour‑educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs had reduced HO‑1, ARG1 and PD‑L1 and increased MHCII, CD86 and CD40 (Fig. 3b). Conditional knockout of NRF2 in GMPs (Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3) resulted in decreased differentiation into TREM2hi mo‑macs and increased CD86+MHCII+ mo‑macs (Fig. 3c). GMPs from Brusatol‑treated tumour‑bearing mice differentiated into more immunostimulatory mo‑macs (Fig. 3d).",NRF2 can also directly influence pro‑inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30‑33).,"Thus, manipulating ROS burden and NRF2 activation in BM GMPs influenced subsequent mo‑mac phenotype in the TME."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NRF2 regulates mo-mac function in the TME,"Tumour‑educated Nfe2l2TKO BMDMs exhibited increased ROS burden, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial stress, and increased sensitivity to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 7c‑d). Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice had reduced TREM2hi mo‑macs, which were more susceptible to cell death (Extended Data Fig. 8d).",NRF2 confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress and cell death (Ref: 28‑30).,NRF2 activity is required for the survival of immunosuppressive mo‑macs in the TME.
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis,"Tamoxifen administration from the time of KP tumour implantation (early) in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with tamoxifen administration at later stages of progression (Fig. 4g). Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling was associated with a decrease in BM GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4h), reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4i), and accumulation of more immunostimulatory mo‑macs (Fig. 4j‑k).",Monocyte‑derived macrophages often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1) and tumour‑enhanced myelopoiesis fuels these populations (Ref: 2).,Early attenuation of NRF2 signalling in Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3CreERT2 mice resulted in a greater reduction in tumour when compared with later attenuation.
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: NRF2 enhances immunoregulatory myelopoiesis,"Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 mice had a significant reduction in CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig. 4b) and reduced PD‑L1‑expressing TREM2hi mo‑macs in the TME (Fig. 4c‑d). Keap1ΔMs4a3 mice displayed significantly larger tumours and more abundant TREM2hi mo‑macs expressing PD‑L1 (Extended Data Fig. 8c‑e). Mixed‑BM chimeras with 1:1 reconstitution of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 and WT showed decreased expansion of Nfe2l2ΔMs4a3 donor‑derived GMPs, lower mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes, and relatively fewer TREM2hi mo‑macs (Extended Data Fig. 8h).",NRF2 promotes antioxidant and cytoprotective programs that support immunosuppressive myeloid cell development (Ref: 28‑33).,"NRF2 activation sustains immunosuppressive myelopoiesis, promoting tumour growth."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,Subsection: Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy,"Combination treatment with the NRF2 inhibitor Brusatol and anti‑PD‑1 significantly reduced tumour burden (Fig. 4l), reduced CMP, GMP and cMoP numbers (Fig. 4m), reduced mobilization of CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. 4n), decreased abundance of mo‑macs, specifically PD‑L1+TREM2hi mo‑macs, and increased CD86+MHCII+ mo‑macs (Fig. 4o). Combination of Brusatol and anti‑PD‑1 prolonged survival beyond anti‑PD‑1 monotherapy (Extended Data Fig. 10e).",Monocyte‑derived macrophages often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (Ref: 1) and limit the efficacy of checkpoint blockade.,Targeting myeloid NRF2 potentiates immunotherapy.
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells,"CYP46A1 mRNA was upregulated in C1‑Liver cell lines and inversely correlated with PCSK9 expression (Fig. 4e). Conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Tumour‑adjacent hepatocytes expressed higher levels of ABCA1 relative to non‑adjacent hepatocytes (Fig. 4j,k). CYP46A1 knockout reduced KP4 growth in the liver without affecting in vitro proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 9l‑o).","24‑HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36, 37).","These data suggest that C1‑Liver‑derived 24‑HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed‑forward manner to support continued LDL‑cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth."
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells,"Targeted metabolomics confirmed higher 7‑DHC and 7‑DHD in HPAC (C2‑Lung) versus KP4 (C1‑Liver) cells (Fig. 5b,c). C2‑Lung lines were collectively more resistant to GPX4 inhibitors (Fig. 5f). Addition of exogenous 7‑DHC or 7‑DHD rescued KP4 cells from RSL3‑induced death (Fig. 5g–j). Pre‑treatment of KPC1 cells with 7‑DHC or 7‑DHD enhanced lung colonisation following tail‑vein injection (Fig. 5j,k). Knockout of PCSK9 or SC5D sensitised HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 10c‑e) and reduced lung colonisation (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g).","The 5,7‑diene B ring structure of 7‑DHC functions as a radical‑trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref: 40‑42).","These findings indicate that sterol intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2‑Lung cells from ferroptosis, thereby promoting lung colonisation."
Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity,Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range,"Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). All four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs.","Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).","These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development."
Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity,Transplanted enhancers are accessible,Allele-specific ATAC-seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a).,"It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-distance enhancers(Ref: 34,35).","These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range."
Range extender mediates long-distance enhancer activity,The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range,"All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b).","Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41).","Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene."
Taurine from tumour niche drives glycolysis to promote leukaemogenesis,TAUT loss impairs leukaemogenesis,"TAUT loss does not severely impact bone marrow cellularity, or the total numbers of HSCs, progenitors and differentiated cells at steady‑state (Extended Data Fig. 7a–e).","These results are consistent with previous studies showing that genetic loss of LSC‑enriched genes such as CD98 (Ref: 1), STAU2 (Ref: 6), MSI2 (Ref: 28,29), BRD4 (Ref: 30) and BCL2 (Ref: 31) can impair HSC self‑renewal.","These results suggest that, while TAUT loss does not impair steady‑state haematopoiesis, it can impact long‑term HSC self‑renewal and maintenance."
Taurine from tumour niche drives glycolysis to promote leukaemogenesis,Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia,"TAUT loss resulted in a 2.2‑ to 3‑fold reduction in activated mTOR, p70S6k and pEIF4B as compared to the controls (Fig. 5k–m).","Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.","Collectively, our studies show that the taurine‑TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG‑mediated activation of mTOR signalling."
