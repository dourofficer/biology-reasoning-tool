CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,crem,CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo,"Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction.","Although previous research has highlighted the inhibitory effects of CREM in T cells and macrophages (Ref: 15,19,20), its specific role in NK cells, especially in the context of CAR-NK cell antitumour activity, remains underexplored.",We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18).
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,crem,CREM is upregulated through the PKA–CREB axis,"CAR stimulation resulted in marked CREB phosphorylation in CAR70 NK cells but not in NT or CAR-NK cells with mutated or absent CD3ζ signalling (CAR70.3ζ.Y6F and CD27(ECD), respectively; Fig. 2a,b).",These data paralleled previous observations of CREB phosphorylation by PKA downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) signalling (Ref: 31).,"To determine whether CREM is also induced through the PKA–CREB axis, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,crem,CREM is upregulated through the PKA–CREB axis,CREM KO led to both the upregulation and downregulation of direct CREM target genes.,Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35),integrative analysis of our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells.
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,metformin,Dependency on mitochondrial respiration,Treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (Ref: 18) (50 µM) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f).,metformin-a commonly used oral anti-diabetic drug and pharmacologic inhibitor of complex I (Ref: 18)-,"consistent with the genetic knockdown studies, treatment with metformin at a clinically relevant concentration (Ref: 18) (50 µM) suppressed the competitive advantage of mutant cells in vitro (Fig. 1f)."
Metformin reduces the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H HSPCs,metformin,Reversal of aberrant epigenetic profiles,"Metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples (Fig. 4c,d).","the Dnmt3aR878H mutation was previously found to be associated with a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) (Ref: 25), indicating its potential influence on another layer of epigenetic regulation.","Consistent with our hypothesis, metformin treatment restored H3K27me3 levels in Dnmt3aR878H/+ samples to a level resembling that of untreated Dnmt3a+/+ samples"
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,myeloid,NSCLC influences chromatin state of BM progenitors,"We observed a similar expansion of GMPs, cMoPs and CD157+Ly6Chi monocytes in the KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and ruled out any contribution of bone metastases (Extended Data Fig. 2c).",Tumour-induced myelopoiesis has been observed across several cancers (Ref: 5-8),"These observations were further supported by our analysis of histone CUT&RUN data showing H3K4me3 signal (enriched proximal to promoter regions) was gained in tumour-associated myeloid progenitors in genomic regions associated with oxidative stress handling, detoxification, chromatin remodelling and proliferation (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1k)."
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,myeloid,Tumour-induced myelopoiesis fuels TME mo-macs,"Tumour-primed GMPs differentiated into more immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME, characterized by increased differentiation into GPNMB+CD9+TREM2hi mo-macs (Ref: 23) expressing higher PD-L1, increased ARG1+ mo-macs (Ref: 24) and decreased frequency of CD86+MHCII+ immunostimulatory mo-macs (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c).",Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Ref: 1),These results collectively suggest that exposure of myeloid progenitors to tumour cues affected their ultimate trajectory in the TME.
Myeloid progenitor dysregulation fuels immunosuppressive macrophages in tumours,myeloid,NRF2 signalling dampens IFN response in the TME,Nfe2l2 and aggregate score for NRF2 downstream gene activation were highest in immunoregulatory ARG1hi and TREM2hi mo-macs (Fig. 2d).,NRF2 can directly influence pro-inflammatory signals by suppressing type I IFN pathway genes and limiting inflammasome activation (Ref: 30-33).,These results suggested that oxidative stress-induced cytoprotective chromatin changes initiated in tumour-educated myeloid progenitors are maintained in tumoural mo-macs.
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,pcsk9,Organ preference correlates with PDAC subtype,"Classical PDAC displays features of poor differentiation, whereas classical PDAC is well-differentiated.","Prior transcriptional profiling studies have shown that PDAC can be stratified into two main transcriptional subtypes termed ‘basal’ and ‘classical’, which are linked to distinct molecular features and patient prognosis (Ref: 17-21).","We find that classical gene signatures were enriched in C2-Lung lines, whereas liver avidity was negatively correlated with this subtype (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g and Supplementary Table 2)."
