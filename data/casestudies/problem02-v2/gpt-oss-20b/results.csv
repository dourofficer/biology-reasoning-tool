CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells in vivo,"Elevated CREM expression in post-infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14).",We focused our attention on CREM given the well-established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15-18).,"Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR-NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is upregulated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells,"Tumour-infiltrating NK (TI-NK) cells showed higher CREM expression than NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), especially those from bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and lung cancer (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This pattern held across multiple cancer types in the TI-NK cell atlas, in which CREM was consistently increased in TI-NK cells compared with PBMC NK cells (Ref: 26) (Extended Data Fig. 5b). CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g).",CREM was enriched in mature NK1 clusters from an atlas of NK cell heterogeneity (Ref: 28) (Extended Data Fig. 5g).,"Collectively, our findings indicate that CREM is prominently expressed in TI-NK cells across various cancers and that, in a healthy context, its expression is associated with a more mature NK cell phenotype."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced through the PKA–CREB axis,The kinetics of IL-15-induced cAMP and pCREB paralleled that of CREM induction. IL-15 increased intracellular cAMP in a dose-dependent manner and activated the PKA and CREB kinase in NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 7c). We observed dose-dependent phosphorylation of CREB with increasing IL-15 (Fig. 2e–i).,"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30).",This suggests that IL-15 triggers a known PKA–CREB signalling cascade that leads to CREM induction.
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced through the PKA–CREB axis,The PKA inhibitor H89 abrogated CREM transcription after IL-15 stimulation.,"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30).","Importantly, the PKA inhibitor H89 abrogated CREM transcription after IL-15 stimulation, confirming the requirement for the PKA–CREB axis."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM is induced through the PKA–CREB axis,Cyclic AMP analog (8-bromo-cAMP) induced CREM expression in NK cells (Fig. 2m) and increased pCREB accordingly (Fig. 2m).,"CREM is regulated through the cAMP signalling pathway (Ref: 29), in which increases in intracellular cAMP levels activate protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as CREB and CREM. These factors then bind cAMP-response elements to regulate the transcription of target genes (Ref: 30).",This confirms that cAMP elevation alone is sufficient to drive CREM transcription.
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,"CREM KO led to both upregulation and downregulation of direct CREM target genes. Consistently downregulated target genes in CREM KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells included those related to exhaustion and stress responses, including BTG1, DUSP2, SMAD3, NFKB2 and RGS1. Conversely, CREM KO upregulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2). Gene set enrichment analysis of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO upregulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it downregulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGFβ signalling.","Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells.","Together, these data suggest that CREM functions as an intracellular checkpoint that modulates NK cell activity via transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"Unexpectedly, interface cells also upregulated genes involved in neuronal development, including SOX11 (log₂FC = 5.15), NNAT (log₂FC = 8.61), NEUROD1 (log₂FC = 6.22) and NEFM (log₂FC = 6.19) (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1).","The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8).",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,Confining A375 cells in vitro also resulted in significant upregulation of acetylated tubulin (P = 6.86 × 10⁻¹²; Fig. 2f-h).,"During migration through confined spaces, neurons assemble a perinuclear network of acetylated tubulin to protect the nucleus (Ref: 22,23).","These data indicate that confined melanoma cells assemble a stable perinuclear tubulin network to reinforce the nucleus against mechanical stress, similar to neurons."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2,"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).",High mobility group proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).,indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) (Extended Data Fig. 10c) abolished the confinement-mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).",The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).,"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex-mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics,Confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower-diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 % versus 4.21 %; P = 1.134 × 10⁻⁵; Fig. 4f).,HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).,"suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2-chromatin interactions in confined cells."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci,Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing (ATAC-seq) of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g).,"The top-ranked motif was an AP-1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 × 10⁻⁴⁹), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).","These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement-induced dedifferentiation program."
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2,We identified robust HMGB2 binding to the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells.,"Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain-2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well-characterized pro-invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50).",This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2-mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10).","Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2).","Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma."
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells,"Conditioned medium from KP4 cells activated LXR target genes (ABCA1, ABCG1, LXRA, PLTP, SREBF1 and APOE) in mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4h). Similarly, treatment with KP4‑conditioned medium but not HPAC‑conditioned medium led to a decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol levels (Extended Data Fig. 9h), suggesting an increased rate of cholesterol efflux occurs in response to KP4‑conditioned medium in hepatocytes. The ability of KP4‑conditioned medium to activate LXR target genes and cholesterol efflux in hepatocytes was lost upon CYP46A1 knockout in KP4 cells, indicating that this response is dependent on CYP46A1 (Extended Data Fig. 9i–k).","Studies in the brain have shown that 24‑HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37).","These data suggest that C1‑Liver derived 24‑HC can condition the liver microenvironment in a feed‑forward manner to support continued LDL‑cholesterol supply, fuelling tumour growth."
PCSK9 drives sterol-dependent metastatic organ choice in pancreatic cancer,Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells,"HPAC cells resisted RSL3‑induced death, as measured by SYTOX Green, whereas KP4 cells were highly sensitive—an effect that was reversed by adding exogenous 7‑DHC or 7‑DHD but not desmosterol (Fig. 5g, j).","The 5,7‑diene B ring structure of 7‑DHC functions as a radical‑trapping agent that suppresses ferroptosis (Ref: 40–42) and sterols with similar structural features, such as 7‑dehydrodesmosterol (7‑DHD), also have anti‑ferroptotic capabilities.",These findings suggest that intermediates of the distal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway protect C2‑Lung cells from oxidative stress.
