crem,CREM is induced in CAR‑NK cells in vivo,"Elevated CREM expression in post‑infusion samples (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) correlated with optimal tumour control in vivo (Ref: 14). This response was characterised by an increased expression of effector genes such as GZMB (which encodes granzyme B), GZMH and GNLY, and genes related to calcium signalling, including S100A10, S100A6 and S100A4 (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1d).",We focused our attention on CREM given the well‑established immunomodulatory role of the cAMP pathway and recent growing interest in targeting it to augment immunotherapy (Ref: 15–18).,"Collectively, these data suggest that CREM is induced in CAR‑NK cells during peak antitumour activity and is associated with a transcriptional profile that balances both activation and regulatory functions."
extender,Medium-range enhancers cannot act at long range,"Replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e).","Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice(Ref: 2).","These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development."
extender,The HS72 enhancer activates Shh at short range,ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b).,"Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb(Ref: 2,41).",These results suggest that the HS72 enhancer can activate functional SHH signalling.
extender,REX is required for long-range activation,"addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a).",Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb(Ref: 33).,"Together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation."
extender,REX is sufficient for long-range activation,KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e).,Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb(Ref: 33).,Combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation.
mechanical,Subsection: Tumour gene expression altered by TME,"interface cells showed clear upregulation of genes characteristic of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1c).","The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others (Ref: 8).",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.
mechanical,Subsection: Confinement induces a neuronal state,"Similar to human interface cells, confined cells upregulated several neuronal pathways (Fig. 1n and Supplementary Table 2).",A previous study showed that tumour nuclei become highly elongated when squeezing through mechanically restrictive environments (Ref: 12).,These data indicate that confinement causes interface cells to adopt a neuronal identity.
mechanical,Subsection: Confinement remodels the cytoskeleton,"Confinement extensively remodelled the MT cytoskeleton; within 2-4 h, curved MTs began encircling the cell and nuclear periphery (Fig. 2a,b).","Neuronal development relies on microtubule (MT) architecture, influencing almost every aspect of neuronal structure and function (Ref: 14).",These results indicate that confined melanoma cells rapidly undergo structural changes in the MT cytoskeleton resembling neurons.
mechanical,Subsection: Confined invasive cells upregulate HMGB2,"In invading tumour cells, HMGB2 was only upregulated in elongated or misshaped tumour cells that appeared to be under mechanical pressure from adjacent tissues (Fig. 3e-g).",High mobility group (HMG)-family proteins regulate chromatin architecture by binding and bending DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 28).,indicating that confinement induces HMGB2 upregulation.
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"In confined cells, tubacin treatment significantly increased both total nuclear HMGB2 accumulation (P = 1.1646 × 10⁻⁷; Extended Data Fig. 9g,h) and the rate of accumulation, which approximately doubled versus controls (0.353 ± 0.0364-fold per hour versus 0.145 ± 0.0171-fold per hour; P = 1.1589 × 10⁻⁶; Extended Data Fig. 9i).",Tubulin acetylation is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1 (Ref: 31) and deacetylation by HDAC6 (Ref: 32).,"confinement‑induced HMGB2 enrichment is linked to MT stability, rather than acetylation state or other HDAC6 functions."
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"Confined A375 cells upregulated nesprin 2 (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b), and targeting SYNE2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the confinement‑mediated accumulation of HMGB2 (Fig. 3n,o) and perinuclear tubulin network (Fig. 3p,q).",The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).,This indicates that nesprin 2 and the tubulin cytoskeleton interact to upregulate HMGB2.
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 upregulation requires nesprin 2,"Lamin A/C increased by approximately 3-fold in confined cells (P = 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁶²; Extended Data Fig. 10d,e), suggesting that the nuclear lamina was remodelled in response to confinement, which we validated by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showing increased nuclear stiffness in confined cells (Extended Data Fig. 10f,g).",The LINC complex cooperates with the nuclear lamina to tune nuclear stiffness (Ref: 36).,"Together, our results demonstrate that confined melanoma cells remodel cytoskeletal and nuclear structures to reinforce the cell against mechanical force, resulting in LINC complex‑mediated HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening."
mechanical,Subsection: Force affects HMGB2-chromatin dynamics,confinement significantly increased the proportion of slower‑diffusing HMGB2 (6.76 ± 0.39% versus 4.21 ± 0.39%; P = 1.134 × 10⁻⁵; Fig. 4f).,HMGB2 typically binds chromatin without sequence specificity and bends DNA to relieve mechanical strain (Ref: 37).,"suggesting more specific, stable HMGB2‑chromatin interactions in confined cells."
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 targets plasticity-associated loci,ATAC‑seq of A375 cells overexpressing HMGB2 showed broadly increased chromatin accessibility (Fig. 4g) and increased accessibility at loci linked to neural crest and neuronal development (Fig. 4h‑j and Supplementary Table 5).,"The top‑ranked motif was an AP‑1 motif (Fig. 4k; P = 1 × 10⁻⁴⁹), implicated in melanoma and melanocyte plasticity (Ref: 40,41).","These data indicate that HMGB2 upregulation increases chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and a neuronal phenotype, promoting a confinement‑induced dedifferentiation program."
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 drives invasion through Notch and BRN2,HMGB2 robustly bound the promoter of Notch signalling genes in both A375 (Extended Data Fig. 11d and Supplementary Table 6) and SKMEL5 (Extended Data Fig. 12d and Supplementary Table 8) cells.,"Notch signalling promotes melanoma invasion through brain‑2 (BRN2, also known as POU3F2) (Ref: 48), a well‑characterized pro‑invasive transcription factor in melanoma (Ref: 49) that also functions in neuronal development (Ref: 50).",This indicates that invasive and neuronal phenotypes in confined interface cells are induced by HMGB2‑mediated upregulation of Notch/BRN2 signalling.
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 ± 0.0025 µm min⁻¹; Extended Data Fig. 13a‑c).,"Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55‑57).",This indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement‑induced phenotypic plasticity in our system.
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,"Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol‑induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d).",Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60).,"indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro‑invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation."
mechanical,Subsection: HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10).","Phenotype switching, particularly the undifferentiated/invasive state, has been linked to drug resistance (Ref: 2).","Together, our results support a role for confinement‑mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro‑invasive and drug‑tolerant state in melanoma."
pcsk9,Sterol dependencies of liver-avid cells,CYP46A1 expression was upregulated in C1‑Liver lines (Fig. 4e) and knockout of CYP46A1 reduced KP4 growth in the liver (Fig. 4f).,"Studies in the brain have shown that 24‑HC, which is synthesized and secreted by neuronal cells, can promote activation of lipoprotein synthesis and cholesterol efflux genes in neighbouring astrocytes via the nuclear hormone receptor liver X receptor (LXR) (Ref: 36,37).",CYP46A1‑mediated oxysterol signalling promotes liver‑specific growth.
pcsk9,Sterol dependencies of lung-avid cells,"High PCSK9 expression correlated with dependency on late‑stage cholesterol biosynthesis genes; knockout of PCSK9 or SC5D sensitised HPAC cells to GPX4 inhibitors and reduced lung colonisation (Extended Data Fig. 10c–e, f,g).",Late‑stage cholesterol intermediates such as 7‑dehydrocholesterol (7‑DHC) act as radical‑trapping agents that suppress ferroptosis (Ref: 40‑42).,"These findings indicate that actively engaging cholesterol biosynthesis simultaneously provides anti‑ferroptotic sterol intermediates that support lung colonization, whereas cells that lack this activity are more susceptible to oxidative stress‑induced cell death."
taurine,Taurine drives glycolysis in leukaemia,"Our experiments showed that while RHEB(Q64L) partially rescued Slc6a6−/− colony formation, this could be fully rescued by RAGA(Q66L) (Fig. 5p).","Amino acid availability can be sensed by RAG GTPases to facilitate mTORC1 localization to the outer lysosomal membrane (Ref: 40) and its interaction with RHEB GTPases (Ref: 41), thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.","Collectively, our studies show that the taurine–TAUT axis regulates glycolysis in myeloid leukaemia cells by promoting RAG‑mediated activation of mTOR signalling."
