Conversely, CREM KO upregulated genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity such as GZMB and IFNG, and transcription factors implicated in T cell and NK cell development (KLF7 and RUNX2). Gene set enrichment analysis of direct CREM targets revealed that CREM KO upregulated pathways crucial for NK cell effector function and metabolism, including MYC and E2F targets, MTORC1 signalling and oxidative phosphorylation. In parallel, it downregulated immunosuppressive pathways such as hypoxia and TGF\u03b2 signalling.", "connecting_principle": "Given the dual function of CREM as both a transcriptional repressor and activator with tissue-specific and cell-specific expression (Ref: 35), we performed integrative analysis of our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data from CREM WT and KO CAR70-IL-15 NK cells.", "interpretation": "Together, these data suggest that CREM functions as an intracellular checkpoint that modulates NK cell activity via transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming."}
