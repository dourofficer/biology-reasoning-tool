Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q2,We quantified minimal migration of confined A375 cells (mean velocity = 0.0838 ± 0.0025 µm min⁻¹; Extended Data Fig. 13a-c),"Previous studies identified a fast amoeboid mode of migration induced by confinement and low adhesion (Ref: 13,55-57)",which indicates that fast amoeboid migration is not a major contributor to confinement-induced phenotypic plasticity in our system
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q1,To test the role of HMGB2 in phenotype switching in vivo,(missing),"we generated BRAFV600E melanomas in zebrafish, in which zebrafish hmgb2a and hmgb2b were inactivated by CRISPR"
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q2,"Loss of hmgb2a and hmgb2b markedly increased melanoma growth, with tumours growing almost 2-fold larger by 10 weeks (P = 0.0193; Fig. 5j-l) while also appearing less invasive than non-targeting controls (Fig. 5m)",(missing),"These data indicate that HMGB2 is required for the invasive state, and that its loss pushes melanoma cells towards a hyperproliferative state"
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q1,We investigated the functional domains that control HMGB2 localization and activity in melanoma,HMGB family proteins contain three functional domains: A-box and B-box DNA-binding domains and an acidic tail regions (Extended Data Fig. 14a),We assembled constructs with each functional domain removed (Extended Data Fig. 14b) and generated stable A375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged versions of each (Extended Data Fig. 14c)
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q2,"In in vitro proliferation and invasion assays, cells expressing either AA-box or AB-box constructs were significantly less proliferative (Extended Data Fig. 14d) but more invasive (Extended Data Fig. 14e), even compared to full-length HMGB2",(missing),probably because of higher expression of these smaller constructs (Extended Data Fig. 14f)
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 mediates phenotype switching,Q2,"when we transplanted cells expressing each deletion construct into mice (Extended Data Fig. 14g), as expected, there was no significant difference in tumour growth rates (Extended Data Fig. 14h,i) or acetylated tubulin at the invasive front (Extended Data Fig. 14j)",(missing),demonstrating that either HMGB2 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to maintain protein function
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,Q1,We examined how the confined invasive state affects therapeutic response,hypothesizing that the HMGB2-high neuronal state induced by confinement may promote drug tolerance,"To test this, we treated confined cells with Taxol to stabilize MTs"
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,Q2,"Unconfined cells rapidly displayed fragmented nuclear morphology and underwent apoptosis, whereas confined cells were almost completely resistant to Taxol-induced cell death (Extended Data Fig. 13d)",(missing),(missing)
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,Q2,(missing),Taxol induces cancer cell death through cell cycle arrest (Ref: 60),"indicating that confinement may cause melanoma cells to exit the cell cycle, in accordance with a pro-invasive phenotype switch associated with downregulation of proliferation"
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,Q1,We then tested the role of HMGB2 in drug tolerance in vivo,(missing),by transplanting human melanoma cells overexpressing HMGB2 into athymic mice and treating the resulting tumours with dabrafenib and trametinib
Mechanical confinement governs phenotypic plasticity in melanoma,HMGB2 is associated with drug tolerance,Q2,"HMGB2 overexpression significantly impaired melanoma response to dabrafenib/trametinib in vivo (P = 0.043; Fig. 5o, Extended Data Fig. 13e and Supplementary Table 10)",(missing),"Together, our results support a role for confinement-mediated upregulation of HMGB2 inducing a pro-invasive and drug-tolerant state in melanoma (Extended Data Fig. 15)"
