Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

Extraction\n\n## Overview\n\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

Overview\n\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).

Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5.

"prompt": "# TASK: Scientific Reasoning Extraction\n\n## Overview\n\nAnalyze the provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.\n\nProcess the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions of Logical Structures\n\n### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] \u2192 Operational Step [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | \"To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells\" |\n| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)\" |\n| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | \"we used CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models\" |\n\n---\n\n### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)\n\n**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.\n\n**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] \u2192 New Insight [outcome]*\n\n| Component | Description | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | \"CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a\u2013d)\" |\n| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a \"lens\" through which the raw data is viewed. | \"These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)\" |\n| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | \"This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation\" |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage\nEvery sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant\u2014if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.\n\n### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction\nExtract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:\n- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., \"Fig. 1a\") as they indicate evidence\n- **Include** reference markers (e.g., \"Ref: 14\") as they indicate literature support\n- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use \"...\" to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.\n\n### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components\nUse `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:\n- If authors state a method without an explicit goal \u2192 `main_content` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles \u2192 `context` = `(missing)`\n- If authors state a result without interpretation \u2192 `outcome` = `(missing)`\n\n**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.\n\n### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet\n- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal \u2192 one method, or one observation \u2192 one interpretation)\n- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each\n- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`\n\n### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations\nNull findings (e.g., \"X did NOT show Y\", \"there was no significant difference\") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.\n\n---\n\n## Handling Special Cases\n\n### Summary/Conclusion Statements\n\nWhen authors provide concluding statements (e.g., \"Collectively...\", \"Together, these data suggest...\", \"These findings indicate...\"):\n\n**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:\n- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)\n- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited\n- `outcome` = the synthesis statement\n\n**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.\n\n### Compound Sentences\n\nIf a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., \"Given X, we did Y and found Z\"):\n\n1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:\n   - If primarily setting up an experiment \u2192 Q1\n   - If primarily reporting data \u2192 Q2\n2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets\n3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)\n\n### Transitional Phrases\n\nPure transitions like \"We next examined...\" or \"We also investigated...\" should be:\n- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal\n- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose\n\n---\n\n## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets\n\n- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)\n- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation\n- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)\n- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paper_title\": \"Title of the paper\",\n  \"extractions\": [\n    {\n      \"subsection\": \"Name of subsection\",\n      \"triplets\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q1\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"Q2\",\n          \"main_content\": \"The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"context\": \"Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)\",\n          \"outcome\": \"The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Decision Flowchart\n\n```\nFor each sentence/clause, ask:\n\n1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #2\n\n2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q1 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #3\n\n3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 main_content\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #4\n\n4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)\n   \u2192 No: Continue to #5\n\n5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?\n   \u2192 Yes: This is Q2 outcome\n   \u2192 No: Re-examine\u2014the sentence likely fits one of the above\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your extraction, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet\n- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)\n- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)\n- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context\n- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit\n- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"To determine whether the canonical PKA\u2013CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Q1 with Context\n\n**Text:** \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q1\",\n  \"main_content\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"context\": \"Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"we also chelated calcium with EGTA\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)\n\n**Text:** \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b).\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Q2\",\n  \"main_content\": \"UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)\",\n  \"context\": \"(missing)\",\n  \"outcome\": \"(missing)\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet\n\n**Text:** \"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i).
