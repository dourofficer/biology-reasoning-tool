CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Overall, CREM WT CAR70–IL-15 NK cells displayed reduced chromatin accessibility when cultured together with tumour cells, whereas CREM KO CAR70–IL-15 NK cells maintained a more open chromatin landscape under the same conditions (Fig. 5f). Notably, CREM KO CAR70–IL-15 NK cells cultured together with tumour cells retained accessibility in most cellular metabolic and effector pathways, including MTORC1, PI3K–AKT–MTOR signalling and the mitotic spindle (Extended Data Fig. 11g).",(missing),(missing)
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Compared with CREM WT, CREM KO CAR70–IL-15 NK cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility at loci associated with activation of E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, G2M targets, MTORC1 signalling and the mitotic spindle",(missing),"a result consistent with an effector, activated and proliferating NK cell phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 11h)."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Indeed, genes associated with effector function (for example, GZMA and PRF1) and transcription factors essential for NK cell maturation and function (for example, EOMES and TBX21) showed increased accessibility in CREM KO CAR70–IL-15 NK cells (Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 11i).",(missing),(missing)
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors (JUND, JUNB, FOSL1–JUND and FOSL1), STAT factors and CEBP factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT CAR70–IL-15 NK cells, whereas ETS-related factors were among the most differentially enriched in CREM WT compared with KO cells (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 11j).",These patterns of enriched AP-1 motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells40,and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells.
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q1,To further dissect the mechanisms by which CREM KO improves NK cell function,(missing),we first assessed IL-15R proximal signalling
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Expression of IL-15R signalling components was comparable between CREM WT and CREM KO NK cells, with some donor-to-donor variability (Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). Similarly, levels of negative regulators of IL-15R signalling, including SOCS1 and CISH, were not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 12a,c).",(missing),(missing)
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q1,"We next investigated whether CREM KO mirrors the biological effects of IL-15R signalling in NK cells, including enhanced proliferation, extended lifespan and improved metabolic fitness.",(missing),(missing)
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"CREM KO CAR-NK cells showed increased proliferation and extended lifespan, particularly in vivo (Fig. 4e,f,i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9i,l).",In keeping with our transcriptomic data of upregulated cell cycle pathways,(missing)
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,"Moreover, metabolic functional assays revealed enhanced glycolytic capacity and a trend towards increased mitochondrial respiration in CREM KO CAR70–IL-15 NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 12d–i).",(missing),"Taken together, these findings indicate that CREM regulates NK cell function by modulating gene expression and chromatin states and by promoting a dysfunctional state (Fig. 5j)."
CREM is a regulatory checkpoint of CAR and IL-15 signalling in NK cells,CREM alters the CAR-NK cell genetic landscape,Q2,(missing),(missing),"This state may be reversed by CREM KO, which leads to increased chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors involved in NK cell activation, especially members of the AP-1 complex, STAT family and CEBP family41–43."
