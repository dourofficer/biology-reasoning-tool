We scored tumour cells for the relative expression of interface genes from our zebrafish transcriptomic datasets","Since the zebrafish model demonstrated that mechanical confinement at the tumor boundary induces a distinct invasive phenotype with specific molecular signatures, and confirming clinical relevance requires validating this spatial-phenotypic relationship in human pathology.",we will perform immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining on human melanoma tumor sections to visualize and quantify the expression of invasive state markers specifically at the tumor-stroma interface compared to the tumor core.

The transition between the proliferative and invasive states is regulated by the transcription factors MITF, SOX9 and SOX10, among others8. MITF and SOX10 regulate melanocyte differentiation and proliferation9,10, whereas SOX9 is associated with the undifferentiated invasive state11",These data indicate that interface cells adopt an invasive state with markers of neuronal development.,"Melanocytes originate from the embryonic neural crest, and the simultaneous loss of lineage-specific master regulators (like MITF) and re-expression of neuronal markers is a well-established signature of lineage dedifferentiation towards a multipotent, neural crest-like progenitor state.","These transcriptomic changes indicate that the interface microenvironment triggers a lineage regression, where melanoma cells abandon their differentiated melanocytic identity to adopt an undifferentiated, neural crest stem cell-like phenotype."
