{"request_id": 0, "reasoning": null, "response": "This paper identifies the transcription factor **CREM (cyclic AMP response element modulator)** as a crucial negative regulatory checkpoint in CAR-NK (Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer) cell immunotherapy.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **CREM Induction in CAR-NK Cells:** Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant upregulation of CREM in CAR-NK cells during peak anti-tumor activity in a mouse tumor model. This induction correlated with transcriptional signatures indicative of both NK cell activation and dysfunction.\n2.  **Dual Pathway Induction:** Both CAR activation (via ITAM signaling) and Interleukin-15 (IL-15) signaling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Other activating cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IL-18) and endogenous NK receptors (CD16, NKp30, NKp46) also contribute to CREM induction.\n3.  **Mechanism of Induction:**\n    *   **PKA-CREB Axis:** CAR activation and IL-15 signaling converge on the PKA-CREB pathway, leading to phosphorylation of CREB. This phosphorylated CREB directly binds to the CREM promoter, initiating its transcription.\n    *   **STAT Pathway (for IL-15):** IL-15 also induces CREM through the JAK-STAT pathway, specifically involving STAT3 and STAT5, with STAT5B directly binding the CREM promoter.\n4.  **CREM Deletion Enhances CAR-NK Potency:** Genetic deletion of CREM (CREM KO) in CAR-NK cells significantly enhances their effector function, including cytotoxicity and cytokine production, in various *in vitro* tumor models and *in vivo* mouse models of lymphoma, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. CREM KO also improves CAR-NK cell proliferation and persistence *in vivo* and increases resistance to tumor-induced immunosuppression upon rechallenge, without observed toxicity.\n5.  **Epigenetic Reprogramming:** CREM exerts its regulatory functions by epigenetically reprogramming CAR-NK cells. It directly binds to genes involved in NK cell activity, suppressing pathways essential for NK function and proliferation (e.g., MYC, E2F targets, MTORC1, oxidative phosphorylation) while upregulating exhaustion- and stress-related genes. CREM KO reverses this, leading to increased chromatin accessibility at loci associated with NK cell activation and function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe study establishes CREM as a critical intracellular immune checkpoint that restrains CAR-NK cell anti-tumor activity. Targeting CREM, for example through genetic deletion, significantly enhances CAR-NK cell potency and persistence, suggesting it as a promising therapeutic target to improve next-generation immunotherapeutic strategies.", "finish_reason": "STOP", "prompt": "Summarize this paper.", "file_path": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/gemini/pdf/crem.pdf"}
{"request_id": 1, "reasoning": null, "response": "This paper investigates how mechanical forces in the tumor microenvironment (TME) drive phenotypic plasticity in melanoma cells, specifically the reversible switch between proliferative and invasive states.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1.  **Interface Cell State:** Using a zebrafish melanoma model and human melanoma samples, the researchers identified a conserved \"interface\" cell state at the tumor-TME boundary. These cells exhibit elongated nuclei, indicative of mechanical confinement by surrounding tissue.\n2.  **Neuronal Gene Program:** Interface cells adopt a \"neuronal invasion\" gene program, characterized by downregulation of proliferative markers (MITF, SOX10) and upregulation of invasive (SOX9) and neuronal development genes (SOX11, NNAT, NEUROD1).\n3.  **Cytoskeletal Remodeling:** *In vitro* confinement of human melanoma cells (A375) recapitulated this neuronal state. Confinement rapidly remodeled the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, forming a stable, perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration, similar to neurons. This process is mediated by the acetyltransferase ATAT1.\n4.  **HMGB2 as a Mediator:** The study identified HMGB2 (High Mobility Group Box 2), a DNA-bending protein, as a key confinement-induced mediator of this neuronal state. HMGB2 was highly upregulated in interface cells in both zebrafish and human samples, and its nuclear concentration increased upon *in vitro* confinement.\n5.  **Chromatin Remodeling:** Confinement stabilized HMGB2's interaction with chromatin, leading to increased chromatin accessibility at loci associated with plasticity and neuronal phenotypes. This suggests that mechanical force, via HMGB2, epigenetically reprograms the cells. HMGB2 binding was found at promoters of AP-1 signaling genes and neuronal genes (e.g., NOTCH2), which drive invasion.\n6.  **Role of LINC Complex:** The perinuclear acetylated tubulin network, through its interaction with the LINC complex protein nesprin 2, transmits mechanical forces to the nucleus, leading to HMGB2 upregulation and nuclear stiffening.\n7.  **Phenotype Switching & Drug Resistance:**\n    *   Confinement of melanoma cells *in vitro* led to reduced proliferation (cell cycle exit).\n    *   Genetic disruption of HMGB2 in zebrafish melanoma *increased* tumor growth and made cells *less* invasive, suggesting HMGB2 regulates the trade-off between proliferation and invasion.\n    *   HMGB2 overexpression in human melanoma cells implanted in mice *impaired* their response to targeted therapies (dabrafenib/trametinib), indicating that the confinement-induced, HMGB2-high neuronal state promotes drug tolerance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe paper demonstrates that mechanical confinement in the TME drives phenotypic switching in melanoma cells from a proliferative to an invasive and drug-tolerant \"neuronal-like\" state. This process involves cytoskeletal remodeling (formation of a perinuclear acetylated tubulin cage), force transmission via the LINC complex, and HMGB2-mediated chromatin remodeling, which alters gene expression to favor neuronal invasion pathways. This mechanism highlights the critical role of the mechanical microenvironment in shaping tumor behavior and therapeutic response.", "finish_reason": "STOP", "prompt": "Summarize this paper.", "file_path": "/mnt/disk2/hiennm/dont/biology-reasoning-tool/data/gemini/pdf/mechanical.pdf"}
