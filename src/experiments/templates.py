# TASK: Scientific Reasoning Extraction

## Overview

Analyze the provided scientific paper excerpt. Your task is to act as a scientific logician and extract the reasoning structures the authors use to construct their narrative. You will identify two distinct types of logical triplets: **Type Q1 (Inquiry Logic)** and **Type Q2 (Discovery Logic)**.

Process the text subsection by subsection, extracting all logical structures.

---

## Definitions of Logical Structures

### Type Q1: Inquiry Logic (The Experimental Setup)

**Concept:** This represents the author's planning phase. It connects a gap in knowledge to a specific action.

**Logic Flow:** *Desire to Know [main_content] + Available Resources/Justification [context] → Operational Step [outcome]*

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `main_content` | The specific research question, knowledge gap, or objective driving the immediate action. It describes *what* the authors want to understand. | "To determine whether CREM functions as a negative regulator in CAR-NK cells" |
| `context` | The background information, prior availability of data, or existing model systems that make the experiment feasible or relevant. This justifies *why* this specific approach was chosen. | "Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33)" |
| `outcome` | The actual methodological step, assay, or analysis performed to achieve the goal. | "we used CRISPR–Cas9 to KO CREM in two CAR-NK cell models" |

---

### Type Q2: Discovery Logic (The Result Interpretation)

**Concept:** This represents the author's synthesis phase. It connects raw data to new biological understanding.

**Logic Flow:** *Empirical Evidence [main_content] + Established Theory [context] → New Insight [outcome]*

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `main_content` | The objective data points, statistical results, or morphological descriptions generated *specifically* in this study. It describes *what* was seen. | "CREM KO significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR-IL-15 NK cells in long-term cultures (Fig. 3a–d)" |
| `context` | Established biological rules, physical laws, or citations from external literature that act as a "lens" through which the raw data is viewed. | "These patterns mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)" |
| `outcome` | The novel conclusion, hypothesis, or meaningful interpretation derived from combining the observation with the context. It describes *what it implies* for the biological system. | "This suggests that CREM acts as an inhibitory checkpoint downstream of IL-15 stimulation" |

---

## Extraction Rules

### Rule 1: Exhaustive Coverage
Every sentence from any results subsection must belong to `main_content`, `context`, or `outcome` of either a Q1 or Q2 triplet. Sentences are rarely redundant—if you're tempted to skip one, reconsider where it fits.

### Rule 2: Verbatim Extraction
Extract text exactly as it appears in the excerpt:
- **Include** figure/table references (e.g., "Fig. 1a") as they indicate evidence
- **Include** reference markers (e.g., "Ref: 14") as they indicate literature support
- **Do NOT** correct grammar, rephrase, truncate mid-sentence, use "..." to shorten the text, or any other measures that compromise the exact extraction of the text.

### Rule 3: Marking Missing Components
Use `(missing)` ONLY when the text contains no explicit statement for that component:
- If authors state a method without an explicit goal → `main_content` = `(missing)`
- If authors state a result without citing literature or principles → `context` = `(missing)`
- If authors state a result without interpretation → `outcome` = `(missing)`

**Important:** Do NOT infer from general scientific knowledge. Only extract what is written.

### Rule 4: One Logical Unit Per Triplet
- Extract ONE triplet per logical unit (one goal → one method, or one observation → one interpretation)
- If a single experiment yields multiple **independent** observations, create separate Q2 triplets for each
- If multiple observations **collectively** support ONE conclusion, group them into one Q2 triplet with combined `main_content`

### Rule 5: Negative Results Are Observations
Null findings (e.g., "X did NOT show Y", "there was no significant difference") ARE valid observations and should be extracted as Q2 `main_content`. Their interpretive significance belongs in `outcome`.

---

## Handling Special Cases

### Summary/Conclusion Statements

When authors provide concluding statements (e.g., "Collectively...", "Together, these data suggest...", "These findings indicate..."):

**Option A (Preferred):** Create a final Q2 triplet for the subsection where:
- `main_content` = the key observations being synthesized (may repeat/combine prior observations)
- `context` = `(missing)` unless literature is cited
- `outcome` = the synthesis statement

**Option B:** If the conclusion directly follows a single observation, attach it as the `outcome` of that Q2 triplet instead of creating a new one.

### Compound Sentences

If a sentence contains elements of both Q1 and Q2 (e.g., "Given X, we did Y and found Z"):

1. Determine the sentence's PRIMARY function:
   - If primarily setting up an experiment → Q1
   - If primarily reporting data → Q2
2. If truly balanced, split into two triplets
3. The secondary elements can inform the appropriate field (e.g., a brief result mention in a Q1 can inform that the method was successful)

### Transitional Phrases

Pure transitions like "We next examined..." or "We also investigated..." should be:
- Incorporated into the Q1 `main_content` if they express a goal
- Marked as `main_content` = `(missing)` if they only introduce a method with no stated purpose

---

## What NOT to Extract as Separate Triplets

- Figure legends or detailed panel descriptions (unless they contain interpretive claims)
- Pure statistical method details without biological interpretation
- Repeated statements of the same finding in different words (consolidate into one triplet)
- Background information in the Introduction (only extract from Results sections)

---

## Output Format

```json
{
  "paper_title": "Title of the paper",
  "extractions": [
    {
      "subsection": "Name of subsection",
      "triplets": [
        {
          "type": "Q1",
          "main_content": "The research question or goal (verbatim) OR (missing)",
          "context": "Background/justification for approach (verbatim) OR (missing)",
          "outcome": "The method/analysis performed (verbatim) OR (missing)"
        },
        {
          "type": "Q2",
          "main_content": "The empirical observation (verbatim) OR (missing)",
          "context": "Literature or established principle (verbatim) OR (missing)",
          "outcome": "The interpretation/conclusion (verbatim) OR (missing)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Decision Flowchart

```
For each sentence/clause, ask:

1. Does it state what the authors WANTED to know or do?
   → Yes: This is Q1 main_content
   → No: Continue to #2

2. Does it state HOW something was done (method/analysis)?
   → Yes: This is Q1 outcome
   → No: Continue to #3

3. Does it report DATA or OBSERVATIONS from this study?
   → Yes: This is Q2 main_content
   → No: Continue to #4

4. Does it cite external literature or state established principles?
   → Yes: This is context (for either Q1 or Q2, depending on what it supports)
   → No: Continue to #5

5. Does it state an INTERPRETATION, CONCLUSION, or IMPLICATION?
   → Yes: This is Q2 outcome
   → No: Re-examine—the sentence likely fits one of the above
```

---

## Self-Validation Checklist

Before finalizing your extraction, verify:

- [ ] Every data-containing sentence is captured in at least one triplet
- [ ] No observation appears as `main_content` in multiple Q2 triplets (avoid redundancy)
- [ ] Q1 triplets have methods (`outcome`) that logically address the stated goal (`main_content`)
- [ ] Q2 triplets have conclusions (`outcome`) that logically follow from observation + context
- [ ] `(missing)` is used only when text is truly absent, not merely implicit
- [ ] Summary statements at subsection ends are handled consistently (either as standalone Q2 or attached to prior triplet)

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete Q1 Triplet

**Text:** "To determine whether the canonical PKA–CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation, we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation."

```json
{
  "type": "Q1",
  "main_content": "To determine whether the canonical PKA–CREB axis is involved in CREM induction after NK cell activation",
  "context": "(missing)",
  "outcome": "we measured phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels in NK cells after CAR or IL-15 stimulation"
}
```

### Example 2: Q1 with Context

**Text:** "Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34), we also chelated calcium with EGTA."

```json
{
  "type": "Q1",
  "main_content": "(missing)",
  "context": "Given the established function of calcium as an activator of PKA (Ref: 32,33) and its pivotal role in the immune cell activation cascade (Ref: 34)",
  "outcome": "we also chelated calcium with EGTA"
}
```

### Example 3: Simple Q2 (Observation Only)

**Text:** "UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)."

```json
{
  "type": "Q2",
  "main_content": "UMAP clearly distinguished the transcriptional profiles of CAR19-IL-15 NK cells before and after infusion (Fig. 1b)",
  "context": "(missing)",
  "outcome": "(missing)"
}
```

### Example 4: Complete Q2 Triplet

**Text:** "Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i). These patterns of enriched AP-1 motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40) and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells."

```json
{
  "type": "Q2",
  "main_content": "Motif enrichment analysis revealed that binding motifs for JUN-related factors were highly enriched in CREM KO compared with WT cells (Fig. 5h,i)",
  "context": "These patterns of enriched AP-1 motifs mirror epigenetic signatures associated with long-lived memory T cells (Ref: 40)",
  "outcome": "and may underlie the enhanced persistence and function of CREM KO CAR-NK cells"
}
```

### Example 5: Summary Statement as Q2

**Text:** "Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity."

```json
{
  "type": "Q2",
  "main_content": "Stimulation with CD70 antigen increased CREM expression only in CAR70 NK cells. IL-15 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CREM expression. Stimulation with both CD70 antigen and exogenous IL-15 resulted in an additive increase in CREM expression.",
  "context": "(missing)",
  "outcome": "Collectively, these findings indicate that both CAR ITAM signalling and IL-15 are potent inducers of CREM in NK cells, thereby highlighting their complex interplay in regulating NK cell activity."
}
```

### Example 6: Negative Result

**Text:** "CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells."

```json
{
  "type": "Q2",
  "main_content": "CREM KO did not have a significant effect on the function of NT NK cells",
  "context": "(missing)",
  "outcome": "(missing)"
}
```
